TI  - Spatial and temporal distribution of pathogenic Wolbachia strain wMelPop in
      Drosophila melanogaster central nervous system under different temperature
      conditions.

AB  - The pathogenic Wolbachia strain, wMelPop, of Drosophila melanogaster is
      propagated in the fly's brain and muscles. To determine how wMelPop spreads in
      the host's central nervous system (CNS) during its life cycle, we used
      whole-mount fluorescent in-situ hybridization to demonstrate the spatial
      distribution of wMelPop in D.melanogaster larvae and adults. To assess the effect
      of temperature on the pattern of wMelPop spread, we performed this analysis under
      moderate (25 degrees C) and high (29 degrees C) temperature conditions. Wolbachia
      distribution pattern in the third instar larva and adult brain was similar at
      both temperatures. wMelPop was generally localized to the subesophageal ganglion 
      and the central brain of the host, whereas optic lobe anlagen cells of third
      instar larvae and cells of the optic lobe, lamina and retina of adult flies were 
      mostly free of bacteria. Interestingly, high temperature had no significant
      effect on wMelPop titer or localization in the brain during larval development,
      but considerably altered it in adults immediately after eclosion. At both
      temperatures and within all tested stages of the life cycle, the bacterial titer 
      varied only slightly between individuals. The observed differences in wMelPop
      titers in the central brain, subesophageal ganglion and optic lobe anlagen cells 
      of third instar larva's CNS, together with the observation that these patterns
      are conserved in the adult brain, suggest that Wolbachia distribution is
      determined during fly embryogenesis.

TI  - Rat retinal transcriptome: Effects of aging and AMD-like retinopathy.
AB  - Pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of
      vision loss in the elderly, remains poorly understood due to the paucity of
      animal models that fully replicate the human disease. Recently, we showed that
      senescence-accelerated OXYS rats develop a retinopathy similar to human AMD. To
      identify alterations in response to normal aging and progression of AMD-like
      retinopathy, we compared gene expression profiles of retina from 3- and 18-mo-old
      OXYS and control Wistar rats by means of high-throughput RNA sequencing
      (RNA-Seq). We identified 160 and 146 age-regulated genes in Wistar and OXYS
      retinas, respectively. The majority of them are related to the immune system and 
      extracellular matrix turnover. Only 24 age-regulated genes were common for the
      two strains, suggestive of different rates and mechanisms of aging. Over 600
      genes showed significant differences in expression between the two strains. These
      genes are involved in disease-associated pathways such as immune response,
      inflammation, apoptosis, Ca ( 2+) homeostasis and oxidative stress. The altered
      expression for selected genes was confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis. To our
      knowledge, this study represents the first analysis of retinal transcriptome from
      young and old rats with biologic replicates generated by RNA-Seq technology. We
      can conclude that the development of AMD-like retinopathy in OXYS rats is
      associated with an imbalance in immune and inflammatory responses. Aging alters
      the expression profile of numerous genes in the retina, and the genetic
      background of OXYS rats has a profound impact on the development of AMD-like
      retinopathy.

TI  - Low Genetic Diversity in Wide-Spread Eurasian Liver Fluke Opisthorchis felineus
      Suggests Special Demographic History of This Trematode Species.
PG  - e62453
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0062453 [doi]
AB  - Opisthorchis felineus or Siberian liver fluke is a trematode parasite
      (Opisthorchiidae) that infects the hepato-biliary system of humans and other
      mammals. Despite its public health significance, this wide-spread Eurasian
      species is one of the most poorly studied human liver flukes and nothing is known
      about its population genetic structure and demographic history. In this paper, we
      attempt to fill this gap for the first time and to explore the genetic diversity 
      in O. felineus populations from Eastern Europe (Ukraine, European part of
      Russia), Northern Asia (Siberia) and Central Asia (Northern Kazakhstan). Analysis
      of marker DNA fragments from O. felineus mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase
      subunit 1 and 3 (cox1, cox3) and nuclear rDNA internal transcribed spacer 1
      (ITS1) sequences revealed that genetic diversity is very low across the large
      geographic range of this species. Microevolutionary processes in populations of
      trematodes may well be influenced by their peculiar biology. Nevertheless, we
      suggest that lack of population genetics structure observed in O. felineus can be
      primarily explained by the Pleistocene glacial events and subsequent sudden
      population growth from a very limited group of founders. Rapid range expansion of
      O. felineus through Asian and European territories after severe bottleneck points
      to a high dispersal potential of this trematode species.

AB  - It is known that a lot of genes having a distinct expression pattern require the 
      complex system of transcription regulation. The regulatory regions of such genes 
      can include not only the 5'-flanking regions, but also other regions,
      particularly their intron sequences. The Drosophila melanogaster Trithorax-like
      (Trl) gene, encoding the GAGA protein, is one of the genes with complex
      expression pattern. GAGA is one of a few transcription factors that can regulate 
      gene expression at multiple levels. The GAGA-mediated modulation of expression
      seems to be linked with modifications of the chromatin structure. Nowadays, the
      regulatory potential of the Trl 5'-flanking region that contains multiple GAGA
      binding sites has been analyzed, but the presence of the functionally significant
      elements in other Trl regions has not been examined. We found DNase I
      hypersensitive sites, evolutionary-conserved sequences and numerous GAGA binding 
      sites in the second intron of the Trl gene. Interestingly, these sequences
      localize in two main regions of the intron in immediate proximity to preferred
      regions of transposon insertions. Additionally, we revealed that deletion of the 
      intron fragment in the Trl(1-72) mutants caused an alteration of the Trl
      expression pattern. These results allow us to conclude that the second intron of 
      the Trl gene contains functionally significant elements.

AB  - The methods for constructing "chaotic" nonlinear systems of differential
      equations modeling gene networks of arbitrary structure and dimensionality with
      various types of symmetry are considered. It has been shown that an increase in
      modality of the functions describing the control of gene expression efficiency
      allows for a decrease in the dimensionality of these systems with retention of
      their chaotic dynamics. Three-dimensional "chaotic" cyclic systems are
      considered. Symmetrical and asymmetrical attractors with "narrow" chaos having a 
      Moebius-like structure have been detected in such systems. As has been
      demonstrated, a complete symmetry of the systems with respect to permutation of
      variables does not prevent the emergence of their chaotic dynamics.

AB  - Maternally inherited microorganisms can influence the mtDNA pattern of variation 
      in hosts. This influence is driven by selection among symbionts and can cause the
      frequency of mitochondrial variants in the population to eventually increase or
      decrease. Wolbachia infection is common and widespread in Drosophila melanogaster
      populations. We compared genetic variability of D. melanogaster mitotypes with
      Wolbachia genotypes among isofemale lines associated with different geographic
      locations and time intervals to study coevolution of the mtDNA and Wolbachia.
      Phylogenetic analysis of D. melanogaster mtDNA revealed two clades diverged in
      Africa, each associated with one of the two Wolbachia genotype groups. No
      evidence of horizontal transmission of Wolbachia between maternal lineages has
      been found. All the mtDNA variants that occur in infected isofemale lines are
      found in uninfected isofemale lines and vice versa, which is indicative of a
      recent loss of infection from some maternal fly lineages and confirms a
      significant role of Wolbachia in the D. melanogaster mtDNA pattern of variation. 
      Finally, we present a comparative analysis of biogeographic distribution of D.
      melanogaster mitotypes all over the world.

AB  - Reproductive functions in adult organism are known to be affected by different
      factors. Effects of social environment at the postnatal ontogenesis attract
      particular attention since it has deep impact on the development of physiological
      and emotional state of an individual. Effects of chronic social isolation at
      different ages on male sexual motivation, testosterone and corticosterone
      response under conditions of sexual arousal were studied in Wistar rats. After
      weaning at 21 day of age, rats of one group were isolated for six weeks and after
      that they were housed in groups of five per cage for ten weeks (Iso3-9). Rats of 
      the second group were housed in groups of five animals per cage till 13 weeks of 
      age, and then they were isolated for six weeks (Iso13-19). Rats of the control
      group were housed in groups during the experiment. Adult 19 week- old male rats
      were tested under conditions of sexual arousal. The expression of sexual
      motivation was estimated as the behavioral activity of a male at the transparent 
      perforated partition separating a receptive female. Isolation of adult male rats 
      reduced the number of approaches to the partition, while the period of time a
      male spent at the partition was not changed and testosterone response was
      enhanced as compared to control rats. Chronic social isolation during
      peri-adolescence reduced sexual motivation and prevented arousal-induced
      elevation of testosterone. Plasma corticosterone increases at sexual arousal in
      the two groups of isolated rats did not differ from that in controls. Our results
      are evidence that social isolation during the post-maturity stage (Iso13-19) did 
      not diminish the manifestation of sexual motivation and hormonal response to a
      receptive female, while isolation during peri-adolescence attenuated behavioral
      and hormonal expression of sexual arousal in adult males.

AB  - Pluripotency is maintained by a complex system that includes the genetic and

      (transcription factors, signal pathways, and microRNAs) closely interacts with
      the enzymes and other specific proteins that participate in the formation of the 
      chromatin structure. The interaction between the two systems results in the
      unique chromatin state observed in pluripotent cells. In this review, the
      epigenetic features of embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells
      are considered. Special attention is paid to the interplay of the transcription
      factors OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG with the Polycomb group proteins and other
      molecules involved in the regulation of the chromatin structure. The
      participation of the transcription factors of the pluripotency system in the
      inactivation of the X chromosome is discussed. In addition, the epigenetic events
      taking place during reprogramming of somatic cells to the pluripotent state and
      the problem of "epigenetic memory" are considered.

TI  - Capping protein beta is required for actin cytoskeleton organisation and cell
      migration during Drosophila oogenesis.

AB  - Capping protein (CP) is a well-characterised actin-binding protein important for 
      regulation of actin filament (AF) assembly. CP caps the barbed end of AFs,
      inhibiting the addition and loss of actin monomers. In Drosophila melanogaster,
      the gene encoding CP beta-subunit is named capping protein beta (cpb; see Hopmann
      et al. [1996] J Cell Biol 133: 1293-305). The cpb level is reduced in the
      Drosophila bristle actin cytoskeleton and becomes disorganised with abnormal
      morphology. A reduced level of the CP protein in ovary results in disruption of
      oocyte determination, and disturbance of nurse cell (NC) cortical integrity and
      dumping. We describe novel defects appearing in cpb mutants during oogenesis, in 
      which cpb plays an important role in border and centripetal follicle cell
      migration, ring canal development and cytoplasmic AF formation. The number of
      long cytoplasmic AFs was dramatically reduced in cpb hypomorphs and abnormal
      actin aggregates was seen on the inner side of NC membranes. A hypothesis to
      explain the formation of abnormal short-cut cytoplasmic AFs and actin aggregates 
      in the cpb mutant NCs was proffered, along with a discussion of the reasons for
      'dumpless' phenotype formation in the mutants.
