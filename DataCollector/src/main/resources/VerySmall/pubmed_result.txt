TI  - Functional study of the upregulation of miRNA-27a and miRNA-27b in 3T3-L1 cells
      in response to berberine.

AB  - Berberine is the major active component of Rhizoma Coptidis derived from a
      traditional Chinese herbal medicine and is known to regulate micro (mi)RNA
      levels, although the mechanism for this action remains unknown. The present study
      confirmed that treatment of 3T3L1 cells with berberine inhibited cell viability
      and differentiation in a dose and timedependent manner, and significantly
      increased the mRNA expression levels of miRNA27a and miRNA27b. In addition, in
      3T3L1 cells treated with berberine, overexpression of miRNA27a and miRNA27b
      improved the berberine-mediated inhibition of cell differentiation and reduction 
      of triglyceride contents. By contrast, miRNA27a and miRNA27b inhibitors
      attenuated the berberinemediated inhibition of cell differentiation and reduction
      of triglyceride contents. Additionally, peroxisome proliferatoractivated
      receptors (PPAR)gamma was confirmed to be a target of miRNA27a in the 3T3L1
      cells. A dualluciferase reporter assay indicated that the expression of PPARgamma
      was negatively regulated by miRNA-27a. These findings may provide novel
      mechanistic insight into the antiobesity effects of certain compounds in
      traditional Chinese herbal medicine.

      proliferation via PTEN suppression.

AB  - Micro (mi)RNA dysregulation is implicated in the development of myelodysplastic
      syndrome (MDS). Chromosomal abnormalities on 1q are frequently detected in Korean
      patients with MDS; however, how these are related to disease development is
      unknown. The present study compared the expression profiles of miRNAs encoded by 
      chromosome 1q between 65 MDS patients and 11 controls. We found that miR-205-5p
      levels were 12.5 fold higher in the former (P=0.001). miR-205-5p level was
      increased in 44.7% of patients when an arbitrary 2(-DeltaCt) cut-off value of
      1.25 was used. miR-205-5p expression data were used to generate a receiver
      operating characteristic (ROC) curve for miR-205-5p, for which the area under the
      curve (AUC) was 0.825 (95% confidence interval: 0.710-0.941; P=0.001). Moreover, 
      transfection with a miR-205-5p mimic induced cell proliferation by inhibiting the
      expression of the tumor suppressor protein phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN).
      Our findings suggest that miR-205-5p upregulation contributes to MDS by
      suppressing PTEN and that miR-205-5p thus acts as an oncogene in hematopoietic
      cells.

TI  - Transduction of hematopoietic stem cells to stimulate RNA interference against
      feline infectious peritonitis.
LID - 1098612X16654958 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The goals of the study were: (1) to develop and evaluate
      non-replicating lentivirus vectors coding for feline coronavirus (FCoV)-specific 
      micro (mi)RNA as a potential antiviral therapy for feline infectious peritonitis 
      (FIP); (2) to assess the feasibility of transducing hematopoietic stem cells
      (HSCs) with ex vivo introduction of the miRNA-expressing lentivirus vector; and
      (3) to assess the ability of the expressed miRNA to inhibit FCoV replication in
      HSCs in vitro. METHODS: HSCs were obtained from feline bone marrow and replicated
      in vitro. Three lentiviruses were constructed, each expressing a different
      anti-FCoV miRNA. HSCs were stably transduced with the miRNA-expressing lentivirus
      vector that produced the most effective viral inhibition in a feline cell line.
      The effectiveness of the transduction and the expression of anti-FCoV miRNA were 
      tested by infecting the HSCs with two different strains of FCoV. The inhibition
      of coronavirus replication was determined by relative quantification of the
      inhibition of intracellular viral genomic RNA synthesis using real-time,
      reverse-transcription PCR. The assessment of virus replication inhibition was
      determined via titration of extracellular virus using the TCID50 assay. RESULTS: 
      Inhibition of FCoV was most significant in feline cells expressing miRNA-L2 that 
      targeted the viral leader sequence, 48 h postinfection. miRNA-L2 expression in
      stably transduced HSCs resulted in 90% and 92% reductions in FIPV WSU 79-1146
      genomic RNA synthesis and extracellular virus production, respectively, as well
      as 74% and 80% reduction in FECV WSU 79-1683 genomic RNA synthesis and
      extracellular virus production, respectively, as compared with an infected
      negative control sample producing non-targeting miRNA. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE:
      These preliminary results show that genetic modification of HSCs for constitutive
      production of anti-coronavirus miRNA will reduce FCoV replication.

TI  - Artemisia capillaris formula inhibits hepatic steatosis via an miR122induced
      decrease in fatty acid synthase expression in vivo and in vitro.
PG  - 4751-8
LID - 10.3892/mmr.2016.5131 [doi]
AB  - Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a widespread health concern, and
      there is currently insufficient understanding regarding its pathogenesis and
      treatment. The present study aimed to explore the effects of Artemisia capillaris
      formula (ACF) on highfat dietinduced hepatic steatosis and fatty acidinduced
      intracellular lipid accumulation, by micro (mi)RNA regulation. A total of 72
      SpragueDawley rats were divided into six groups (n=12/group). One group was
      designated as the control group and fed a normal diet, and the remaining five
      groups were allowed ad libitum access to a highfat diet for eight weeks, in order
      to establish an NAFLD rat model. The rats were subsequently administered polyene 
      phosphatidylcholine (PP; 0.076 g/kg body weight/day), low dose of ACF (0.462 g/kg
      body weight/day), middle dose of ACF (0.924 g/kg body weight/day) or high dose of
      ACF (1.848 g/kg body weight/day) intragastrically for four weeks. HepG2 human
      hepatocellular carcinoma cells were treated with oleic acid and palm acid,
      followed by treatment with various concentrations of ACF. Serum alanine
      transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), triglycerides (TG), total
      cholesterol (TC), highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC), lowdensity
      lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC), and steatotic HepG2 human liver carcinoma cell TC
      and TG levels were measured. ACF and PP treatments attenuated highfat dietinduced
      hepatic steatosis and fatty acidinduced intracellular lipid accumulation. A
      modified highfat diet significantly increased ALT, AST, TG, TC, LDLC levels and
      decreased HDLC levels. Treatment with ACF and PP abrogated the increase in liver 
      enzymes and TG, TC and LDLC levels, but did not influence HDLC levels in a
      highfat diet induced rat model of steotosis. Steatotic HepG2 cells exhibited
      significantly increased levels of both TG and TC. Treatment with ACF
      significantly decreased TC and TG levels in vivo, and ACF and PP treatment
      decreased the expression levels of fatty acid synthase (FASN) and increased
      miR122 in vivo and in vitro. In conclusion, these results suggested that ACF may 
      inhibit hepatic steatosis via miR122induced downregulation of FASN in vivo and in
      vitro.

AB  - Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the major histological type of
      head and neck cancer and no curative treatments are currently available. Using
      advanced sequencing technologies, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has produced
      largescale sequencing data, which provide unprecedented opportunities to reveal
      molecular mechanisms of cancer. The present study analyzed the mRNA and micro
      (mi)RNA expression data of HNSCC and normal control tissues released by the TCGA 
      database using a bioinformatics approach to explore underlying molecular
      mechanisms. The mRNA and miRNA expression data were downloaded from the TCGA
      database and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and miRNAs (DEMs) between
      HNSCC and normal head and neck tissues were identified using TwoClassDif.
      Subsequently, the gene functions and pathways which are significantly altered in 
      HNSCC were identified using Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
      and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis. Regulatory networks among DEGs
      and DEMs were then constructed, and transcription factors (TFs) potentially
      regulating the DEGs and DEMs were determined and a TF miRNA gene network was
      established. A total of 2,594 significant DEGs (1,087 upregulated and 1,507
      downregulated), and 25 DEMs (8 upregulated and 17 downregulated) were identified 
      in HNSCC compared with normal control samples. These DEGs were significantly
      enriched in GOs and KEGG pathways such as mitosis, cell cycle, Wnt, JAK/STAT and 
      TLR signaling pathway. CPBP, NFAT1 and miR1 were situated in the central hub of
      the TF miRNA gene network, underlining their central roles in regulatory
      processes specific for HNSCC. The present study enhanced the current
      understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying HNSCC and may offer novel
      strategies for its prevention, diagnosis and treatment.

TI  - miRNA-27b levels are associated with CYP3A activity in vitro and in vivo.
PG  - e00192
LID - 10.1002/prp2.192 [doi]
AB  - Previous in vitro studies have shown that microRNA-27b (miR-27b) may regulate
      mRNA levels of CYP3A4, vitamin D receptor (VDR), and Peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha) as well as CYP3A4 protein
      expression and activity. In vitro studies have also shown that vitamin D may
      affect the expression of CYP3A4. The primary aim of this pilot study was to
      investigate the association between miR-27b and CYP3A expression and activity.
      The secondary aim was to investigate the association between 25-hydroxy vitamin D
      in serum and CYP3A activity. Mi-RNA-27b was quantified using real-time PCR in
      serum samples (n = 28) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D was measured and correlated with
      the levels of the endogenous CYP3A activity marker 4beta-hydroxycholesterol. In
      addition, the correlation between miR-27b and CYP3A activity, measured by
      dextromethorphan N-demethylation and 6beta-hydroxylation of testosterone and the 
      gene expression of CYP3A4, VDR and PPAR alpha were assessed in 20 human liver
      samples. A significant association between circulatory miR-27b levels and
      4beta-hydroxycholesterol ratio was found; P = 0.04, and between hepatic miR-27b
      levels and CYP3A activity, measured by dextromethorphan N-demethylation in human 
      liver (P = 0.04). There was no association between hepatic miR-27b and mRNA
      levels of CYP3A4, VDR or PPAR alpha. There was a significant association between 
      serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and 4beta-hydroxycholesterol ratio, P = 0.002.
      In conclusion, this pilot-study supports the hypothesis that miR-27b levels as
      well as 25-hydroxyvitamin D may affect CYP3A activity in vivo. The results
      indicate that miR-27b exerts its inhibitory effect on a translational level
      rather than affecting mRNA levels.

TI  - Role of MiR-126a-3p in Endothelial Injury in Endotoxic Mice.
PG  - e639-50
LID - 10.1097/CCM.0000000000001629 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Sepsis poses a serious global health problem with an overall mortality
      rate of 30%, in which the vascular injury is a major contributor. The study is to
      determine the expression profile of micro-RNAs in endotoxic vascular walls and
      their potential roles in sepsis-related vascular injury. DESIGN: Prospective
      randomized study. SETTING: Laboratory investigation. SUBJECTS: Male C57BL/6 mice,
      average weight 26.5 +/- 1.8 g. INTERVENTIONS: Endotoxemia was induced in mice via
      lipopolysaccharide injection (20 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). 
      The control mice were injected with the same amount of saline (500 muL,
      intraperitoneal). In a subgroup of mice, a high dose of lipopolysaccharide (30
      mg/kg, intraperitoneal) was applied to induce endotoxin-related death.
      MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The mi-RNA expression profiles in aortas from
      lipopolysaccharide-induced endotoxic mice were determined. The result
      demonstrated that some micro-RNAs were aberrantly expressed in endotoxic mouse
      arteries. Among them, the endothelial cell-enriched/endothelial cell-specific
      miR-126a-3p was significantly down-regulated in endotoxic mouse arteries, septic 
      human vessels, as well as vascular endothelial cells isolated from endotoxic mice
      or treated with lipopolysaccharide. The down-regulation of miR-126a-3p occurred
      at transcriptional level via the decreased expression of Kruppel-like factor 2,
      which could be inhibited by Kruppel-like factor 2 over-expression via adenovirus 
      expressing Kruppel-like factor 2. The down-regulation of miR-126a-3p in
      endothelial cells resulted in the increased apoptosis, and decreased
      proliferation and migration, which were inhibited by miR-126a-3p mimics. In vivo,
      over-expression of miR-126a-3p via lentivirus attenuated endotoxemia-induced
      injuries on endothelial function and vascular permeability. We found that SPRED1 
      and VCAM-1 were two direct target genes of miR-126a-3p related to
      miR-126a-3p-mediated effects in endotoxemia. Finally, the survival rate of
      endotoxic mice was significantly increased by the over-expression of miR-126a-3p.
      CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that vascular micro-RNAs such as miR-126a-3p may
      represent novel mechanisms and new therapeutic targets for endotoxemia-induced
      vascular injury and endotoxic mortality.

TI  - [Inhibition of microRNA195 attenuates high-glucose induced neonatal
      cardiomyocytes hypertrophy in vitro].
PG  - 712-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of micro(mi) RNA-195 on high-glucose
      induced neonatal cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and to explore the related mechanism. 
      METHODS: The potential target gene of miRNA-195 (Smad7) was predicted by
      TargetScan5. 1 software. Cardiomyocytes were isolated from neonatal SD rats and
      cells were then randomly divided into three groups: cells treated by culture
      medium containing 5 mmol/L glucose (control group) , by culture medium containing
      25 mmol/L glucose (high glucose group) and treated by culture medium containing
      25 mmol/L glucose and miRNA-195 inhibitor transfection (miRNA-195 inhibitor
      group). After 24, 48, or 72 h of in vitro culture, the morphology of
      cardiomyocytes was examined under phase contrast microscope. Micrographs were
      captured and the cell surface was calculated. The mRNA expressions of miRNA-195
      and myosin heavy chain beta (beta-MHC), a biomarker for cardiomyocyte
      hypertrophy, in cardiomyocytes were detected by RT-PCR. The protein expression of
      Smad7 was determined by Western blot. The concentration of transforming growth
      factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) in the supernatant of culture medium was measured by
      ELISA. RESULTS: Cross-sectional area of cardiomyocytes, expression of miRNA-195
      and beta-MHC and secretion of TGF-beta1 were significantly increased in high
      glucose-treated cells (P < 0.05 vs. normal control). The protein expression of
      Smad7 was significantly downregulated in cells exposed to high glucose for 48 h
      (P < 0.05 vs. normal control). Downregulation of miRNA-195 partly reversed the
      high glucose-induced effects. The expression of Smad7 was negatively correlated
      with miRNA-195 in high glucose control group (correlation coefficient: -0.945, P 
      < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that Smad7 could be the target gene 
      of miRNA-195. miRNA-195 might play a crucial role in the development and
      progression of diabetic cardiomyopathy possibly through downregulating the
      expression of Smad7 and modulating TGF-beta/Smad pathways.

TI  - The Drosophila tricellular junction protein Gliotactin regulates its own mRNA
      levels through BMP-mediated induction of miR-184.
PG  - 1477-89
LID - 10.1242/jcs.178608 [doi]
AB  - Epithelial bicellular and tricellular junctions are essential for establishing
      and maintaining permeability barriers. Tricellular junctions are formed by the
      convergence of three bicellular junctions at the corners of neighbouring
      epithelia. Gliotactin, a member of the Neuroligin family, is located at
      theDrosophilatricellular junction, and is crucial for the formation of
      tricellular and septate junctions, as well as permeability barrier function.
      Gliotactin protein levels are tightly controlled by phosphorylation at tyrosine
      residues and endocytosis. Blocking endocytosis or overexpressing Gliotactin
      results in the spread of Gliotactin from the tricellular junction, resulting in
      apoptosis, delamination and migration of epithelial cells. We show that
      Gliotactin levels are also regulated at the mRNA level by micro (mi)RNA-mediated 
      degradation and that miRNAs are targeted to a short region in the 3'UTR that
      includes a conserved miR-184 target site. miR-184 also targets a suite of septate
      junction proteins, including NrxIV, coracle and Mcr. miR-184 expression is
      triggered when Gliotactin is overexpressed, leading to activation of the BMP
      signalling pathway. Gliotactin specifically interferes with Dad, an inhibitory
      SMAD, leading to activation of the Tkv type-I receptor and activation of Mad to
      elevate the biogenesis and expression of miR-184.

TI  - Exosome-like vesicles released from lipid-induced insulin-resistant muscles
      modulate gene expression and proliferation of beta recipient cells in mice.
PG  - 1049-58
LID - 10.1007/s00125-016-3882-y [doi]
AB  - AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The crosstalk between skeletal muscle (SkM) and beta cells plays
      a role in diabetes aetiology. In this study, we have investigated whether
      SkM-released exosome-like vesicles (ELVs) can be taken up by pancreatic beta
      cells and can deliver functional cargoes. METHODS: Mice were fed for 16 weeks
      with standard chow diet (SCD) or with standard diet enriched with 20% palmitate
      (HPD) and ELVs were purified from quadriceps muscle. Fluorescent ELVs from HPD or
      SCD quadriceps were injected i.v. or intramuscularly (i.m.) into mice to
      determine their biodistributions. Micro (mi)RNA quantification in ELVs was
      determined using quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)-based TaqMan low-density
      arrays. Microarray analyses were performed to determine whether standard diet
      ELVs (SD-ELVs) and high palmitate diet ELVs (HPD-ELVs) induced specific
      transcriptional signatures in MIN6B1 cells. RESULTS: In vivo, muscle ELVs were
      taken up by pancreas, 24 h post-injection. In vitro, both SD-ELVs and HPD-ELVs
      transferred proteins and miRNAs to MIN6B1 cells and modulated gene expressions
      whereas only HPD-ELVs induced proliferation of MIN6B1 cells and isolated islets. 
      Bioinformatic analyses suggested that transferred HPD-ELV miRNAs may participate 
      in these effects. To validate this, we demonstrated that miR-16, which is
      overexpressed in HPD-ELVs, was transferred to MIN6B1 cells and regulated Ptch1,
      involved in pancreas development. In vivo, islets from HPD mice showed increased 
      size and altered expression of genes involved in development, including Ptch1,
      suggesting that the effect of palm oil on islet size in vivo was reproduced in
      vitro by treating beta cells with HPD-ELVs. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our data 
      suggest that muscle ELVs might have an endocrine effect and could participate in 
      adaptations in beta cell mass during insulin resistance.

TI  - Analysis of Clinical and Molecular Factors Impacting Oncologic Outcomes in
      Undifferentiated Pleomorphic Sarcoma.
PG  - 2220-8
LID - 10.1245/s10434-016-5115-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas (UPS) present a diagnostic and 
      therapeutic challenge. Identification of prognostic molecular markers is required
      for the discovery of novel treatment approaches. The purpose of this study was to
      correlate clinicopathologic variables, expression of tyrosine kinase receptors,
      and markers of cell cycle progression and survival with oncologic outcomes.
      METHODS: A tissue microarray containing 208 primary UPS samples was analyzed by
      immunohistochemistry for protein markers and in situ hybridization for microRNA. 
      Staining results were correlated with clinicopathologic features and oncologic
      outcomes. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to assess
      associations between expression of protein markers, mi-RNA, and outcome. RESULTS:
      At a median follow-up of 3.9 years (9 years for survivors), 5-year
      disease-specific survival (DSS) was 63 %. Clinical variables associated with
      improved DSS included age <61 years, tumor size <10 cm, margin-negative
      resection, and sporadic-tumor status. At the protein level, loss of cyclin D1 (p 
      = 0.06), pEGFR (p = 0.023), pIGF-1R (p = 0.022), and PTEN (p < 0.001) and
      overexpression of AXL (p = 0.015) were associated with reduced DSS on univariate 
      analysis. Ki67, PCNA, and pEGFR were more highly expressed in sporadic UPS than
      radiation-associated (RA-UPS), whereas RA-UPS samples expressed higher levels of 
      both phosphorylated and total IGF-1R. DISCUSSION: Loss of cyclin D1,
      overexpression of AXL, and loss of PTEN are associated with poor cancer-specific 
      outcomes and warrant further investigation in UPS. The differences in protein
      expression in sporadic versus RA-UPS may indicate that the activated molecular
      signaling nodes may be different for each specific histology and also could
      explain the aggressive phenotype seen in RA-UPS compared with the sporadic
      lesions.

AB  - The RNA binding proteins RBM binding motif protein 38 (RBM38) and DEAD END 1
      (DND1) selectively stabilize mRNAs by attenuating RNAse activity or protecting
      them from micro(mi)RNA-mediated cleavage. Furthermore, both proteins can
      efficiently stabilize the mRNA of the cell cycle inhibitor p21(CIP1). Since acute
      myeloid leukemia (AML) differentiation requires cell cycle arrest and RBM38 as
      well as DND1 have antiproliferative functions, we hypothesized that decreased
      RBM38 and DND1 expression may contribute to the differentiation block seen in
      this disease. We first quantified RBM38 and DND1 mRNA expression in clinical AML 
      patient samples and CD34(+) progenitor cells and mature granulocytes from healthy
      donors. We found significantly lower RBM38 and DND1 mRNA levels in AML blasts and
      CD34(+) progenitor cells as compared to mature neutrophils from healthy donors.
      Furthermore, the lowest expression of both RBM38 and DND1 mRNA correlated with
      t(8;21). In addition, neutrophil differentiation of CD34(+) cells in vitro with
      G-CSF (granulocyte colony stimulating factor) resulted in a significant increase 
      of RBM38 and DND1 mRNA levels. Similarly, neutrophil differentiation of NB4 acute
      promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells was associated with a significant induction of
      RBM38 and DND1 expression. To address the function of RBM38 and DND1 in
      neutrophil differentiation, we generated two independent NB4RBM38 as well as DND1
      knockdown cell lines. Inhibition of both RBM38 and DND1 mRNA significantly
      attenuated NB4 differentiation and resulted in decreased p21(CIP1) mRNA
      expression. Our results clearly indicate that expression of the RNA binding
      proteins RBM38 and DND1 is repressed in primary AML patients, that neutrophil
      differentiation is dependent on increased expression of both proteins, and that
      these proteins have a critical role in regulating p21(CIP1) expression during APL
      differentiation.

TI  - Low Intensity Exercise Training Improves Skeletal Muscle Regeneration Potential.
PG  - 399
LID - 10.3389/fphys.2015.00399 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine whether 12 days of
      low-to-moderate exercise training at low altitude (598 m a.s.l.) improves
      skeletal muscle regeneration in sedentary adult women. METHODS: Satellite cells
      were obtained from the vastus lateralis skeletal muscle of seven women before and
      after this exercise training at low altitude. They were investigated for
      differentiation aspects, superoxide anion production, antioxidant enzymes,
      mitochondrial potential variation after a depolarizing insult, intracellular
      Ca(2+) concentrations, and micro (mi)RNA expression (miR-1, miR-133, miR-206).
      RESULTS: In these myogenic populations of adult stem cells, those obtained after 
      exercise training, showed increased Fusion Index and intracellular Ca(2+)
      concentrations. This exercise training also generally reduced superoxide anion
      production in cells (by 12-67%), although not in two women, where there was an
      increase of ~15% along with a reduced superoxide dismutase activity. miRNA
      expression showed an exercise-induced epigenetic transcription profile that was
      specific according to the reduced or increased superoxide anion production of the
      cells. CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows that low-to-moderate exercise
      training at low altitude improves the regenerative capacity of skeletal muscle in
      adult women. The differentiation of cells was favored by increased intracellular 
      calcium concentration and increased the fusion index. This low-to-moderate
      training at low altitude also depicted the epigenetic signature of cells.

PG  - 2138-2144
AB  - The present study aimed to investigate the roles of the vascular endothelial cell
      growth factor (VEGF) and micro (mi)RNA-210 in the metastasis of primary
      medulloblastoma (MB) tumors. A total of 86 adult patients diagnosed with
      cerebellar MB were enrolled in the present study, of which 11 patients had
      metastatic MB in the subarachnoid space. The following samples were collected: MB
      primary tumor tissue, MB secondary tumor tissue, tumor adjacent tissues and
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Immunohistochemical analyses of the tissue samples
      were conducted in order to detect patterns of VEGF expression. In addition, the
      expression levels of VEGF mRNA and miRNA-210 were analyzed using reverse
      transcription-quantititative polymerase chain reaction, and western blot analyses
      were used to investigate VEGF protein expression levels. The positive expression 
      rate of VEGF was significantly higher in MB tumor tissue, as compared with
      adjacent tissues (P<0.01). In addition, VEGF mRNA and protein expression levels
      in MB primary and secondary tumor tissues, and in the CSF of patients with
      metastatic MB, were significantly upregulated, as compared with tumor adjacent
      tissues and the CSF of patients with non-metastatic MB, respectively (P<0.01).
      miRNA-210 expression levels were significantly upregulated in MB tumor tissues,
      the CSF of patients with metastatic MB and in tumor tissues of metastatic MB
      (P<0.01). In the present study, the expression levels of VEGF and miRNA-210 were 
      upregulated in patients with MB and metastatic MB; thus suggesting that miRNA-210
      may promote the metastasis of MB primary tumors by regulating the expression of
      VEGF.

TI  - Circulating microRNA Profiles in Patients with Type-1 Autoimmune Hepatitis.
PG  - e0136908
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0136908 [doi]
AB  - Recent studies have demonstrated that micro (mi)RNA molecules can be detected in 
      the circulation and can serve as potential biomarkers of various diseases. This
      study used microarray analysis to identify aberrantly expressed circulating
      miRNAs in patients with type 1 autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) compared with healthy
      controls. Patients with well-documented and untreated AIH were selected from the 
      National Hospital Organization (NHO)-AIH-liver-network database. They underwent
      blood sampling and liver biopsy with inflammation grading and fibrosis staging
      before receiving treatment. To further confirm the microarray data, circulating
      expression levels of miR-21 and miR-122 were quantified by real-time quantitative
      polymerase chain reaction in 46 AIH patients, 40 patients with chronic hepatitis 
      C (CHC), and 13 healthy controls. Consistent with the microarray data, serum
      levels of miR-21 were significantly elevated in AIH patients compared with CHC
      patients and healthy controls. miR-21 and miR-122 serum levels correlated with
      alanine aminotransferase levels. Circulating levels of miR-21 and miR-122 were
      significantly reduced in AIH patients with liver cirrhosis, and were inversely
      correlated with increased stages of fibrosis. By contrast, levels of circulating 
      miR-21 showed a significant correlation with the histological grades of
      inflammation in AIH. We postulate that aberrantly expressed serum miRNAs are
      potential biomarkers of AIH and could be implicated in AIH pathogenesis.
      Alternations of miR-21 and miR-122 serum levels could reflect their putative
      roles in the mediation of inflammatory processes in AIH.

TI  - Lectin-induced agglutination method of urinary exosomes isolation followed by
      mi-RNA analysis: Application for prostate cancer diagnostic.
PG  - 68-79
LID - 10.1002/pros.23101 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men. Prostate-specific
      antigen has, however, insufficient diagnostic specificity. Novel complementary
      diagnostic approaches are greatly needed. MiRNAs are small regulatory RNAs which 
      play an important role in tumorogenesis and are being investigated as a cancer
      biomarker. In addition to their intracellular regulatory functions, miRNAs are
      secreted into the extracellular space and can be found in various body fluids,
      including urine. The stability of extracellular miRNAs is defined by association 
      with proteins, lipoprotein particles, and membrane vesicles. Among the known
      forms of miRNA packaging, tumour-derived exosome-enclosed miRNAs is thought to
      reflect the vital activity of cancer cells. The assessment of the exosomal
      fraction of urinary miRNA may present a new and highly specific method for
      prostate cancer diagnostics; however, this is challenged by the absence of
      reliable and inexpensive methods for isolation of exosomes. METHODS: Prostate
      cancer (PC) cell lines and urine samples collected from 35 PC patients and 35
      healthy donors were used in the study. Lectins, phytohemagglutinin, and
      concanavalin A were used to induce agglutination of exosomes. The efficiency of
      isolation process was evaluated by AFM and DLS assays. The protein content of
      isolated exosomes was analysed by western blotting. Exosomal RNA was assayed by
      automated electrophoresis and expression level of selected miRNAs was evaluated
      by RT-qPCR. The diagnostic potency of the urinary exosomal miRNA assessment was
      estimated by the ROC method. RESULTS: The formation of multi-vesicular
      agglutinates in urine can be induced by incubation with lectin at a final
      concentration of 2 mg/ml. These agglutinates contain urinary exosomes and may be 
      pelleted by centrifugation with a relatively low G-force. The analysis of
      PC-related miRNA in urinary exosomes revealed significant up-regulation of
      miR-574-3p, miR-141-5p, and miR-21-5p associated with PC. CONCLUSIONS:
      Lectin-induced aggregation is a low-cost and easily performed method for
      isolation of exosomes from urine. Isolated exosomes can be further analysed in
      terms of miRNA content. The miRNA profile of urinary exosomes reflects
      development of prostate cancer and may present a promising diagnostic tool.

TI  - A five-miRNA signature with prognostic and predictive value for MGMT
      promoter-methylated glioblastoma patients.
PG  - 29285-95
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.4978 [doi]
AB  - Although O(6)-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation
      status is an important marker for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), there is
      considerable variability in the clinical outcome of patients with similar
      methylation profiles. The present study aimed to refine the prognostic and
      predictive value of MGMT promoter status in GBM by identifying a micro (mi)RNA
      risk signature. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas was used for this study, with
      MGMT promoter-methylated samples randomly divided into training and internal
      validation sets. Data from The Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas was used for
      independent validation. A five miRNA-based risk signature was established for
      MGMT promoter-methylated GBM to distinguish cases as high- or low-risk with
      distinct prognoses, which was confirmed using internal and external validation
      sets. Importantly, the prognostic value of the signature was significant in
      different cohorts stratified by clinicopathologic factors and alkylating
      chemotherapy, and a multivariate Cox analysis found it to be an independent
      prognostic marker along with age and chemotherapy. Based on these three factors, 
      we developed a quantitative model with greater accuracy for predicting the 1-year
      survival of patients with MGMT promoter-methylated GBM. These results indicate
      that the five-miRNA signature is an independent risk predictor for GBM with MGMT 
      promoter methylation and can be used to identify patients at high risk of
      unfavorable outcome and resistant to alkylating chemotherapy, underscoring its
      potential for personalized GBM management.

      Reveals Promising Novel Biomarkers.

LID - 10.3390/ijms160816953 [doi]
AB  - MicroRNAs control the differentiation and function of B cells, which are
      considered key elements in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus
      (SLE). However, a common micro(mi)RNA signature has not emerged since published
      data includes patients of variable ethnic background, type of disease, and organ 
      involvement, as well as heterogeneous cell populations. Here, we aimed at
      identifying a miRNA signature of purified B cells from renal and non-renal severe
      SLE patients of Latin American background, a population known to express severe
      disease. Genome-wide miRNA expression analyses were performed on naive and memory
      B cells and revealed two categories of miRNA signatures. The first signature
      represents B cell subset-specific miRNAs deregulated in SLE: 11 and six miRNAs
      discriminating naive and memory B cells of SLE patients from healthy controls
      (HC), respectively. Whether the miRNA was up or down-regulated in memory B cells 
      as compared with naive B cells in HC, this difference was abolished in SLE
      patients, and vice versa. The second signature identifies six miRNAs associated
      with specific pathologic features affecting renal outcome, providing a further
      understanding for SLE pathogenesis. Overall, the present work provided promising 
      biomarkers in molecular diagnostics for disease severity as well as potential new
      targets for therapeutic intervention in SLE.

AB  - Adenovirus (AdV) 'virus-associated' RNAs (VA RNAs) are exceptionally abundant (up
      to 10(8)copies/cell), heterogeneous, non-coding RNA transcripts ( approximately
      150-200 nucleotides). The predominant species, VA RNAI, is best recognized for
      its essential function in relieving the cellular anti-viral blockade of protein
      synthesis through inhibition of the double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase 
      (PKR). More recent evidence has revealed that VA RNAs also interfere with several
      other host cell processes, in part by virtue of the high level to which they
      accumulate. Following transcription by cellular RNA polymerase III, VA RNAs
      saturate the nuclear export protein Exportin 5 (Exp5) and the cellular
      endoribonculease Dicer, interfering with pre-micro (mi)RNA export and miRNA
      biogenesis, respectively. Dicer-processed VA RNA fragments are incorporated into 
      the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) as 'mivaRNAs', where they may
      specifically target cellular genes. VA RNAI also interacts with other innate
      immune proteins, including OAS1. While intact VA RNAI has the paradoxical effect 
      of activating OAS1, a non-natural VA RNAI construct lacking the entire Terminal
      Stem has been reported to be a pseudoinhibitor of OAS1. Here, we show that a VA
      RNAI construct corresponding to an authentic product of Dicer processing
      similarly fails to activate OAS1 but also retains only a modest level of
      inhibitory activity against PKR in contrast to the non-natural deletion
      construct. These findings underscore the complexity of the arms race between
      virus and host, and highlight the need for further exploration of the impact of
      VA RNAI interactions with host defenses on the outcome of AdV infection beyond
      that of well-established PKR inhibition. Additional contributions of VA RNAI
      heterogeneity resulting from variations in transcription initiation and
      termination to each of these functions remain open questions that are discussed
      here.

TI  - Micro(mi) RNA-34a targets protein phosphatase (PP)1gamma to regulate DNA damage
      tolerance.
PG  - 3830-41
LID - 10.1080/15384101.2015.1064202 [doi]
AB  - The DNA damage response (DDR) triggers widespread changes in gene expression,
      mediated partly by alterations in micro(mi) RNA levels, whose nature and
      significance remain uncertain. Here, we report that miR-34a, which is upregulated
      during the DDR, modulates the expression of protein phosphatase 1gamma (PP1gamma)
      to regulate cellular tolerance to DNA damage. Multiple bio-informatic algorithms 
      predict that miR-34a targets the PP1CCC gene encoding PP1gamma protein. Ionising 
      radiation (IR) decreases cellular expression of PP1gamma in a dose-dependent
      manner. An miR-34a-mimic reduces cellular PP1gamma protein. Conversely, an
      miR-34a inhibitor antagonizes IR-induced decreases in PP1gamma protein
      expression. A wild-type (but not mutant) miR-34a seed match sequence from the 3' 
      untranslated region (UTR) of PP1CCC when transplanted to a luciferase reporter
      gene makes it responsive to an miR-34a-mimic. Thus, miR-34a upregulation during
      the DDR targets the 3' UTR of PP1CCC to decrease PP1gamma protein expression.
      PP1gamma is known to antagonize DDR signaling via the
      ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) kinase. Interestingly, we find that cells
      exposed to DNA damage become more sensitive - in an miR-34a-dependent manner - to
      a second challenge with damage. Increased sensitivity to the second challenge is 
      marked by enhanced phosphorylation of ATM and p53, increased gammaH2AX formation,
      and increased cell death. Increased sensitivity can be partly recapitulated by a 
      miR-34a-mimic, or antagonized by an miR-34a-inhibitor. Thus, our findings suggest
      a model in which damage-induced miR-34a induction reduces PP1gamma expression and
      enhances ATM signaling to decrease tolerance to repeated genotoxic challenges.
      This mechanism has implications for tumor suppression and the response of cancers
      to therapeutic radiation.

TI  - Construction of interference vector targeting Ep-CAM gene and its effects on
      colorectal cancer cell proliferation.
PG  - 2647-52
LID - 10.2147/DDDT.S82917 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prior study indicates that abnormal protein expression and functional
      changes in the development and progression of colorectal cancer is related to
      gene expression. The aim of this study was to construct an interference plasmid
      targeting the Ep-CAM gene and to investigate its effects on the proliferation of 
      colorectal cancer cells. METHODS: In this study, HT-29 and HCT-116 colorectal
      cancer cell lines were selected as cell models. The double-stranded micro (mi)RNA
      oligo was inserted into the pcDNATM6.2-GW/EmGFPmiR vector, which is an expression
      of miRNA. Lipofectamine 2000 was used to transfer plasmid into the empty plasmid 
      group (transfected pcDNATM6.2-GW/EmGFPmiR-neg) and the interference group
      (transfected pcDNATM6.2-GW/EmGFPmiR-Ep-CAM-1), respectively. Meanwhile, the
      nontransferred HT-29 and HCT-116 acts as the blank control group. Reverse
      transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect the
      transfection efficiency. Western blot was used to detect Ep-CAM protein
      expression. The cell proliferation in each group was detected by using
      3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay.
      RESULTS: The results indicated that the Ep-CAM messenger (m)RNA expression in the
      interference group was lower significantly compared with that of the empty
      plasmid group and control group (P<0.01). Western blot analysis results showed
      that Ep-CAM protein expression was significantly lower in interference group
      compared with that of the empty plasmid group and the control group (P<0.01). MTT
      assay results demonstrated that the proliferation ability of cells in the
      interference group was significantly inhibited compared with the two other groups
      (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Silencing of Ep-CAM can significantly inhibit the
      proliferation of colorectal cancer cells.

TI  - Sexual dimorphism in miR-210 expression and mitochondrial dysfunction in the
      placenta with maternal obesity.
PG  - 1274-81
LID - 10.1038/ijo.2015.45 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Maternal obesity is a major problem in obstetrics, and the placenta
      is involved in obesity-related complications via its roles at the maternal-fetal 
      interface. We have recently shown a causative role for micro(mi)RNA-210, a so
      called 'hypoxamir' regulated by HIF-1alpha, in mitochondrial dysfunction in
      placentas from women with preeclampsia. We also reported mitochondrial
      dysfunction in placentas with maternal obesity. Here we hypothesized that
      expression of miR-210 is dysregulated in the placentas with obesity. METHODS:
      Placentas from uncomplicated pregnancies were collected at term from healthy
      weight or control (CTRL, pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI)<25), overweight (OW,
      BMI=25-24.9) and obese (OB, BMI>30) women following C-section with no labor.
      Expression of miRNA-210 and its target genes was measured by reverse
      transcription-PCR and Western Blot, respectively. Mitochondrial respiration was
      assessed by Seahorse Analyzer in syncytiotrophoblast (ST) 72 h after
      cytotrophoblast isolation. RESULTS: Expression of miR-210 was significantly
      increased in placentas of OB and OW women with female but not male fetuses
      compared with CTRL placentas of females. However, expression of HIF-1alpha in
      these placentas remained unchanged. Levels of tumor-necrosis factor-alpha
      (TNFalpha) were increased in OW and OB placentas of females but not males, and in
      silico analysis suggested that activation of miR-210 expression in these
      placentas might be activated by NFkappaB1 (p50) signaling. Indeed, chromatin
      Immunoprecipitation assay showed that NFkB1 binds to placental miR-210 promoter
      in a fetal sex-dependent manner. Female but not male STs treated with TNFalpha
      showed overexpression of miR-210, reduction of mitochondrial target genes and
      decreased mitochondrial respiration. Pre-treatment of these STs with small
      interfering RNA to NFkB1 or antagomiR-210 prevented the TNFalpha-mediated
      inhibition of mitochondrial respiration. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the
      inflammatory intrauterine environment associated with maternal obesity induces an
      NFkappaB1-mediated increase in miR-210 in a fetal sex-dependent manner, leading
      to inhibition of mitochondrial respiration and placental dysfunction in the
      placentas of female fetuses.

      cell carcinoma.

AB  - Esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC) is an aggressive type of cancer with poor 
      prognosis and leading to decreased quality of life. The identification of
      patients at increased risk of esophageal squamous cell cancer may improve current
      understanding of the role of micro (mi)RNA in tumorigenesis, since the miRNA
      pattern of these patients may be associated with tumorigenesis. In the present
      study, the miRNA and mRNA expression profiles of ESCC tissue samples and adjacent
      normal control tissue samples were obtained from two dependent GEO series.
      Bioinformatics analyses, including the use of the Gene Oncology and Kyoto
      Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes databases, were used to identify genes and
      pathways, which were specifically associated with miRNA-associated ESCC oncology.
      A total of 17 miRNAs and 1,670 probes were differentially expressed in the two
      groups, and the differentially expressed miRNA and target interactions were
      analyzed. The mRNA of miRNA target genes were found to be involve 49 GO terms and
      14 pathways. Of the genes differentially expressed between the two groups,
      miRNA-181a, miRNA-202, miRNA-155, FNDC3B, BNC2 and MBD2 were the most
      significantly altered and may be important in the regulatory network. In the
      present study, a novel pattern of differential miRNA-target expression was
      constructed, which with further investigation, may provide novel targets for
      diagnosing and understanding the mechanism of ESCC.

AB  - Aberrant expressions of micro-ribonucleic acids (miRs) are closely associated
      with the pathogenesis in many human cancers. In oesophageal adenocarcinomas,
      altered expressions of different sets of miRs are noted to be associated with the
      development of adenocarcinoma from Barrett's oesophagus. In different studies,
      miRs such as miR-192, miR-196 and miR-21 were frequently noted to up-regulated
      whereas miR-203, miR-205 and miR-let-7 were commonly down-regulated during the
      development of Barrett's oesophagus to oesophageal adenocarcinoma. In addition,
      changes in the expression of miRs are associated with the predication of
      metastasis, prognosis and response to chemo-radiation in the patients with
      oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Experimental studies in manipulating the miRs in
      cancer cell lines could provide hints for therapeutics for the cancer. However,
      the number of studies reported on these aspects of oesophageal adenocarcinoma was
      limited and the miRs noted needed to be confirmed by additional studies. Overall,
      the mechanisms of involvements of miRs in pathogenesis and progression of
      oesophageal adenocarcinoma are complex. Although miRs have the potential to act
      as prognostic and clinical biomarkers for cancer therapy in oesophageal
      adenocarcinoma, more works in larger populations and clinical trials are needed
      to validate these clinical implications.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the effects of matrine (a
      natural alkaloid) on sorafenib-induced cytotoxicity against hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC) cells, and to explore the molecular mechanisms involved. METHODS:
      HepG2 and Hep3B cells were treated with matrine alone or in combination with
      sorafenib, and cell viability and apoptosis were assessed. The involvement of
      micro (mi)RNA-21 in the action of matrine was examined. RESULTS: Matrine
      significantly augmented the antiproliferative activity of sorafenib in a
      dose-dependent manner. Matrine significantly increased apoptosis, coupled with
      enhanced cleavage of caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase.
      miRNA-21-overexpressing HCC cells showed a marked decrease in matrine-induced
      growth suppression and the expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN).
      The suppressive effect of combining matrine and sorafenib was significantly
      reduced by miRNA-21 overexpression or PTEN inhibition. CONCLUSION: Matrine in
      combination with sorafenib leads to increased cytotoxic effects against HCC
      cells, at least partially, via the suppression of miRNA-21 and the subsequent
      induction of PTEN.

TI  - The role of RNA interference (RNAi) in arbovirus-vector interactions.
PG  - 820-43
LID - 10.3390/v7020820 [doi]
AB  - RNA interference (RNAi) was shown over 18 years ago to be a mechanism by which
      arbovirus replication and transmission could be controlled in arthropod vectors. 
      During the intervening period, research on RNAi has defined many of the
      components and mechanisms of this antiviral pathway in arthropods, yet a number
      of unexplored questions remain. RNAi refers to RNA-mediated regulation of gene
      expression. Originally, the term described silencing of endogenous genes by
      introduction of exogenous double-stranded (ds)RNA with the same sequence as the
      gene to be silenced. Further research has shown that RNAi comprises three gene
      regulation pathways that are mediated by small RNAs: the small interfering
      (si)RNA, micro (mi)RNA, and Piwi-interacting (pi)RNA pathways. The exogenous
      (exo-)siRNA pathway is now recognized as a major antiviral innate immune response
      of arthropods. More recent studies suggest that the piRNA and miRNA pathways
      might also have important roles in arbovirus-vector interactions. This review
      will focus on current knowledge of the role of the exo-siRNA pathway as an
      arthropod vector antiviral response and on emerging research into vector piRNA
      and miRNA pathway modulation of arbovirus-vector interactions. Although it is
      assumed that arboviruses must evade the vector's antiviral RNAi response in order
      to maintain their natural transmission cycles, the strategies by which this is
      accomplished are not well defined. RNAi is also an important tool for arthropod
      gene knock-down in functional genomics studies and in development of
      arbovirus-resistant mosquito populations. Possible arbovirus strategies for
      evasion of RNAi and applications of RNAi in functional genomics analysis and
      arbovirus transmission control will also be reviewed.

AB  - Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a procedure with a
      high risk of treatment related mortality. The primary aim of the present study
      was to examine associations between markers of gastrointestinal toxicity, markers
      of systemic inflammation, and plasma levels of microRNA (miRNA) -155 and -146a
      during the first month after HSCT. The secondary aim was to characterize the
      impact of the toxic-inflammatory response on the function of circulating
      leukocytes during immune recovery. Thirty HSCT patients were included.
      Gastrointestinal injury was monitored by toxicity scores, lactulose-mannitol test
      and plasma citrulline, as a measure of the enterocyte population. Nadir of
      citrulline and maximum of oral toxicity scores, intestinal permeability, CRP and 
      plasma levels of IL-6 and IL-10 was seen at day +7 post-HSCT. miRNA-155 and
      mi-RNA-146a showed an inverse relation with significantly elevated miRNA-155 and 
      decreased miRNA-146a levels, from day 0 to day +28 compared with pre-conditioning
      levels. Citrulline levels below the median at day +7 were associated with higher 
      spontaneous production of IL-6 and TNF-alpha as well as higher in vitro
      stimulated production of IL-17A at day +21. This study is the first to
      demonstrate that toxic responses to chemotherapy are accompanied by differential 
      regulation of miRNAs with opposing effects on immune regulation. We find that a
      proinflammatory miRNA profile is sustained during the first three weeks after the
      transplantation, indicating that these miRNAs may play a role in the regulation
      of the inflammatory environment during immune reconstitution after HSCT.

AB  - The human DNA damage response (DDR) triggers profound changes in gene expression,
      whose nature and regulation remain uncertain. Although certain micro-(mi)RNA
      species including miR34, miR-18, miR-16 and miR-143 have been implicated in the
      DDR, there is as yet no comprehensive description of genome-wide changes in the
      expression of miRNAs triggered by DNA breakage in human cells. We have used
      next-generation sequencing (NGS), combined with rigorous integrative
      computational analyses, to describe genome-wide changes in the expression of
      miRNAs during the human DDR. The changes affect 150 of 1523 miRNAs known in
      miRBase v18 from 4-24 h after the induction of DNA breakage, in cell-type
      dependent patterns. The regulatory regions of the most-highly regulated miRNA
      species are enriched in conserved binding sites for p53. Indeed, genome-wide
      changes in miRNA expression during the DDR are markedly altered in TP53-/- cells 
      compared to otherwise isogenic controls. The expression levels of certain
      damage-induced, p53-regulated miRNAs in cancer samples correlate with patient
      survival. Our work reveals genome-wide and cell type-specific alterations in
      miRNA expression during the human DDR, which are regulated by the tumor
      suppressor protein p53. These findings provide a genomic resource to identify new
      molecules and mechanisms involved in the DDR, and to examine their role in tumor 
      suppression and the clinical outcome of cancer patients.

      among selected vascular plants.
PG  - 1049
LID - 10.1186/1471-2164-15-1049 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Micro (mi)RNAs are important regulators of plant development. Across 
      plant lineages, Dicer-like 1 (DCL1) proteins process long ds-like structures to
      produce micro (mi) RNA duplexes in a stepwise manner. These miRNAs are
      incorporated into Argonaute (AGO) proteins and influence expression of RNAs that 
      have sequence complementarity with miRNAs. Expression levels of AGOs are greatly 
      regulated by plants in order to minimize unwarranted perturbations using miRNAs
      to target mRNAs coding for AGOs. AGOs may also have high promoter
      specificity-sometimes expression of AGO can be limited to just a few cells in a
      plant. Viral pathogens utilize various means to counter antiviral roles of AGOs
      including hijacking the host encoded miRNAs to target AGOs. Two host encoded
      miRNAs namely miR168 and miR403 that target AGOs have been described in the model
      plant Arabidopsis and such a mechanism is thought to be well conserved across
      plants because AGO sequences are well conserved. RESULTS: We show that the
      interaction between AGO mRNAs and miRNAs is species-specific due to the diversity
      in sequences of two miRNAs that target AGOs, sequence diversity among
      corresponding target regions in AGO mRNAs and variable expression levels of these
      miRNAs among vascular plants. We used miRNA sequences from 68 plant species
      representing 31 plant families for this analysis. Sequences of miR168 and miR403 
      are not conserved among plant lineages, but surprisingly they differ drastically 
      in their sequence diversity and expression levels even among closely related
      plants. Variation in miR168 expression among plants correlates well with
      secondary structures/length of loop sequences of their precursors. CONCLUSIONS:
      Our data indicates a complex AGO targeting interaction among plant lineages due
      to miRNA sequence diversity and sequences of miRNA targeting regions among AGO
      mRNAs, thus leading to the assumption that the perturbations by viruses that use 
      host miRNAs to target antiviral AGOs can only be species-specific. We also show
      that rapid evolution and likely loss of expression of miR168 isoforms in tobacco 
      is related to the insertion of MITE-like transposons between miRNA and miRNA*
      sequences, a possible mechanism showing how miRNAs are lost in few plant lineages
      even though other close relatives have abundantly expressing miRNAs.

TI  - Oxidative stress drivers and modulators in obesity and cardiovascular disease:
      from biomarkers to therapeutic approach.
PG  - 582-95
AB  - This review article is intended to describe how oxidative stress regulates
      cardiovascular disease development and progression. Epigenetic mechanisms related
      to oxidative stress, as well as more reliable biomarkers of oxidative stress, are
      emerging over the last years as potentially useful tools to design therapeutic
      approaches aimed at modulating enhanced oxidative stress "in vivo", thereby
      mitigating the consequent atherosclerotic burden. As a paradigm, we describe the 
      case of obesity, in which the intertwining among oxidative stress, due to caloric
      overload, chronic low-grade inflammation induced by adipose tissue dysfunction,
      and platelet activation represents a vicious cycle favoring the progression of
      atherothrombosis. Oxidative stress is a major player in the pathobiology of
      cardiovascular disease (CVD). Reactive oxygen species (ROS)- dependent signaling 
      pathways prompt transcriptional and epigenetic dysregulation, inducing chronic
      low-grade inflammation, platelet activation and endothelial dysfunction. In
      addition, several oxidative biomarkers have been proposed with the potential to
      improve current understanding of the mechanisms underlying CVD. These include
      ROS-generating and/or quenching molecules, and ROS-modified compounds, such as
      F2-isoprostanes. There is also increasing evidence that noncoding micro- RNA
      (mi-RNA) are critically involved in post- transcriptional regulation of cell
      functions, including ROS generation, inflammation, regulation of cell
      proliferation, adipocyte differentiation, angiogenesis and apoptosis. These
      molecules have promising translational potential as both markers of disease and
      site of targeted interventions. Finally, oxidative stress is a critical target of
      several cardioprotective drugs and nutraceuticals, including antidiabetic agents,
      statins, renin-angiotensin system blockers, polyphenols and other antioxidants.
      Further understanding of ROS-generating mechanisms, their biological role as well
      as potential therapeutic implications would translate into consistent benefits
      for effective CV prevention.

TI  - MiR-30a-3p negatively regulates BAFF synthesis in systemic sclerosis and
      rheumatoid arthritis fibroblasts.
PG  - e111266
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0111266 [doi]
AB  - We evaluated micro (mi) RNA-mediated regulation of BAFF expression in fibroblasts
      using two concomitant models: (i) synovial fibroblasts (FLS) isolated from
      healthy controls (N) or Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) patients; (ii) human dermal
      fibroblasts (HDF) isolated from healthy controls (N) or Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) 
      patients. Using RT-qPCR and ELISA, we first showed that SScHDF synthesized and
      released BAFF in response to Poly(I:C) or IFN-gamma treatment, as previously
      observed in RAFLS, whereas NHDF released BAFF preferentially in response to
      IFN-gamma. Next, we demonstrated that miR-30a-3p expression was down regulated in
      RAFLS and SScHDF stimulated with Poly(I:C) or IFN-gamma. Moreover, we
      demonstrated that transfecting miR-30a-3p mimic in Poly(I:C)- and
      IFN-gamma-activated RAFLS and SScHDF showed a strong decrease on BAFF synthesis
      and release and thus B cells survival in our model. Interestingly, FLS and HDF
      isolated from healthy subjects express higher levels of miR-30a-3p and lower
      levels of BAFF than RAFLS and SScHDF. Transfection of miR-30a-3p antisense in
      Poly(I:C)- and IFN-gamma-activated NFLS and NHDF upregulated BAFF secretion,
      confirming that this microRNA is a basal repressors of BAFF expression in cells
      from healthy donors. Our data suggest a critical role of miR-30a-3p in the
      regulation of BAFF expression, which could have a major impact in the regulation 
      of the autoimmune responses occurring in RA and SSc.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is a complex multifactorial metabolic disorder that
      affects >100 million individuals worldwide, yet the mechanisms involved in the
      development and progression of the disease have not yet been fully elucidated.
      The present study examined the mRNA and micro (mi)RNA expression profiles by
      microarray analysis in the pancreas islets of spontaneously diabetic
      Goto-Kakizaki rats with the aim to identify regulatory mechanisms underlying the 
      pathogenesis of T2DM. A total of 9 upregulated and 10 downregulated miRNAs were
      identified, including miR-150, miR-497, miR-344-3p and let-7f, which were
      independently validated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays. In
      addition, differential expression of 670 genes was detected by mRNA microarray
      analysis, including 370 upregulated and 247 downregulated genes. The
      differentially expressed genes were statistically associated with major cellular 
      pathways, including the immune response pathway and the extracellular matrix
      (ECM)-receptor interaction pathway. Finally, a reverse regulatory association of 
      differentially expressed miRNAs and their predicted target genes was constructed,
      supported by analysis of their mRNA and miRNA expression profiles. A number of
      key pairs of miRNA-mRNA was proposed to have significant roles in the
      pathogenesis of T2DM rats based on bioinformatics analysis, one example being the
      let-7f/collagen, type II, alpha 1 pair that may regulate ECM-receptor
      interactions.

AB  - Omalizumab, a humanized mAb that binds to the CH3 domain near the binding site
      for the high-affinity type-I IgE Fc receptors of human IgE, can neutralize free
      IgE and inhibit the IgE allergic pathway without sensitizing mast cells and
      basophils. We found that omalizumab in patients with severe persistent asthma
      (SPA) was an effective therapy for asthma and the following co-morbid conditions:
      chronic urticaria (CU), bee venom allergy, latex allergy, atopic dermatitis, food
      allergy and Samter's syndrome. Information on the use of omalizumab in treatment 
      of asthma and other allergic diseases has improved our understanding that
      treatment acts on many levels, including regulating levels of inflammatory
      proteins, including cytokines (copper-containing alpha- 2-glycoprotein, total
      antioxidant capacity, MDA, NO, H2O2, CXCL8, IL-10, TGF-beta, GMCSF, IL-17,
      IL-1beta), MPV, Hs-CRP, eosinophil cationic peptide, vitamin-D (25(OH)D),
      homocysteine (Hcy), OX-2, d- dimer, albumin, and sApo-2L. The decrease in Hcy
      concentrations and increase in 25(OH)D also support the existence of a vascular
      endothelial protection mechanism. Mediators and cells classically involved in
      pro-coagulant and anticoagulant pathways together play a role in SPA and CU
      pathophysiology and omalizumab effect. The mechanism of action of omalizumab in
      the treatment of asthma is believed to be multifactorial, and includes effects
      mediated through altered production of redox metabolites, extrinsic coagulation
      pathway, oxidative markers-related mi RNA, TRAIL-related mi RNA, and regulation
      of production of known inflammatory proteins.

AB  - In the present study, effects on expression of antioxidant, apoptotic and

      of substances being used in non-surgical sterilization such as quinacrine,
      erythromycin and tetracycline were evaluated in over tissue. Moreover, expression
      of some specific mi-RNA (miR-15b, miR-21, miR34a and miR-98) that playing a role 
      in apoptosis was determined in same tissue. Prospective comparative experimental 
      study. Genetics and Histology laboratory. Total number of 28 Wistar albino 12-14 
      week old female rats with regular cycles and 200-220 grams in weight. Total RNA
      was isolated from tissues by using a RNA isolation kit. Gene expression levels
      were evaluated by Real-Time PCR method. Tubal passage and fibrosis induction in
      tissues was observed in the histochemical analysis. In the statistical analysis
      of data Kruskal-Wallis variance analysis and Mann-Whitney U test were used and p 
      < 0.05 were accepted as significant. While the expressions of target genes found 
      to be increased in quinacrine and erythromycin group when compared to control
      group, this increase was insignificant. In quinacrine group, increase in the SOD1
      expression levels was only statistically significant (p < 0.05). Expression
      levels of miR-15b, miR-21, miR34a and miR-98 microRNAs were found to be
      up-regulated in all experimental groups, despite this, only the increased
      expression miR-34 was found as statistically significant when compared to
      control. Tubal blockage and fibrosis induction scores of quinacrine, erythromycin
      and tetracycline were significantly higher than control. Results of the present
      study suggest that the doses treated of quinacrine, erythromycin and tetracycline

TI  - Circulating miRNAs as potential biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 1261-7
LID - 10.3233/JAD-140756 [doi]
AB  - Several micro(mi)RNA are deregulated in brain, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and
      serum/plasma from patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of the study
      was to profile circulating miRNAs in serum as non-invasive biomarkers for AD,
      correlating them with those identified in CSF, the biological fluid which better 
      reflects biochemical changes occurring during pathological processes in the brain
      and may provide a robust indicator of AD-related disease pathogenesis thanks to
      the evidence of low amyloid and high levels of tau and hyperphosphorylated tau.
      Using a two-step analysis (array and validation through real-time PCR), a
      down-regulation (mean fold change +/- SEM) of miR-125b (0.415 +/- 0.11 versus
      1.381 +/- 0.36, p = 0.009), miR-23a (0.111 +/- 0.03 versus 0.732 +/- 0.14, p <
      0.001), and miR-26b (0.414 +/- 0.11 versus 1.353 +/- 0.39, p < 0.01), out of 84
      tested, was shown in serum from 22 AD patients compared with 18 non-inflammatory 
      and 8 inflammatory neurological controls (NINDCs and INDCs) and 10 patients with 
      frontotemporal dementia. Significant down-regulation of miR-125b and miR-26b was 
      also confirmed in CSF from AD patients versus NINDCs (miR-125b: 0.089 +/- 0.03
      versus 0.230 +/- 0.08, p < 0.001; miR-26b: 0.217 +/- 0.06 versus 1.255 +/- 0.29, 
      p < 0.001, mean fold change +/- SEM, respectively), whereas data were not
      replicated for miR-23a. In serum, miR-125b had an AUC of 0.82 to distinguish AD
      from NINDCs (95% CI: 0.65-0.98, p = 0.005). In conclusion, we demonstrated that
      cell-free miR-125b serum levels are decreased in serum from patients with AD as
      compared with NINDC and distinguish between AD and NINDCs with an accuracy of
      82%.

AB  - Blood born micro(mi)RNA expression pattern have been reported for various human
      diseases with signatures specific for diseases. To evaluate these biomarkers, it 
      is mandatory to know possible changes of miRNA signatures in healthy individuals 
      under different physiological conditions. We analyzed the miRNA expression in
      peripheral blood of elite endurance athletes and moderatly active controls. Blood
      drawing was done before and after exhaustive exercise in each group. After
      Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment we did not find any miRNA with significant p-values
      when comparing miRNA expression between the different groups. We found, however, 
      24 different miRNAs with an expression fold change of minimum 1.5 in at least one
      of the comparisons (athletes before vs after exercise, athletes before exercise
      vs controls and athletes after exercise vs controls). The observed changes are
      not significant in contrast to the expression changes of the blood born miRNA
      expression reported for many human diseases. These data support the idea of
      disease associated miRNA patterns useful as biomarkers that are not readily
      altered by physiological conditions.

TI  - The protein kinase TOUSLED facilitates RNAi in Arabidopsis.
PG  - 7971-80
LID - 10.1093/nar/gku422 [doi]
AB  - RNA silencing is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism triggered by
      double-stranded RNA that is processed into 21- to 24-nt small interfering (si)RNA
      or micro (mi)RNA by RNaseIII-like enzymes called Dicers. Gene regulations by RNA 
      silencing have fundamental implications in a large number of biological processes
      that include antiviral defense, maintenance of genome integrity and the
      orchestration of cell fates. Although most generic or core components of the
      various plant small RNA pathways have been likely identified over the past 15
      years, factors involved in RNAi regulation through post-translational
      modifications are just starting to emerge, mostly through forward genetic
      studies. A genetic screen designed to identify factors required for RNAi in
      Arabidopsis identified the serine/threonine protein kinase, TOUSLED (TSL).
      Mutations in TSL affect exogenous and virus-derived siRNA activity in a manner
      dependent upon its kinase activity. By contrast, despite their pleiotropic
      developmental phenotype, tsl mutants show no defect in biogenesis or activity of 
      miRNA or endogenous trans-acting siRNA. These data suggest a possible role for
      TSL phosphorylation in the specific regulation of exogenous and antiviral RNA
      silencing in Arabidopsis and identify TSL as an intrinsic regulator of RNA
      interference.

AB  - There is increasing research on and clinical interest in the physiological role
      played by platelet microparticles (PMPs). PMPs are 0.1-1-mum fragments shed from 
      plasma membranes of platelets that are undergoing activation, stress, or
      apoptosis. They have a phospholipid-based structure and express functional
      receptors from platelet membranes. As they are the most abundant microparticles
      in the blood and they express the procoagulant phosphatidylserine, PMPs likely
      complement, if not amplify, the functions of platelets in hemostasis, thrombosis,
      cancer, and inflammation, but also act as promoters of tissue regeneration. Their
      size and structure make them instrumental in platelet-cell communications as a
      delivery tool of platelet-borne bioactive molecules including growth factors,
      other signaling molecules and micro (mi)RNA. PMPs can therefore be a
      pathophysiological threat or benefit to the cellular environment when interacting
      with the blood vasculature. There is also increasing evidence that PMP generation
      is triggered during blood collection, separation into components, and storage, a 
      phenomenon potentially leading to thrombotic and inflammatory side effects in
      transfused patients. Evaluating PMPs requires strict pre-analytical and
      analytical procedures to avoid artifactual generation and ensure accurate
      assessment of the number, size repartitioning, and functional properties. This
      review describes the physical and functional methods developed for analyzing and 
      quantifying PMPs. It then presents the functional roles of PMPs as markers or
      triggers of diseases like thrombosis, atherosclerosis, and cancer, and discusses 
      the possible detrimental immunological impact of their generation in blood
      components. Finally we review the potential function of PMPs in tissue
      regeneration and the prospects for their use in therapeutic strategies for human 
      health.

AB  - Dysregulation of microRNA (mi-RNA) expression plays a major role in the
      development and progression of most human malignancies. Members of the miR-200
      family, miR-182, miR-214 and miR-221 are frequently up-regulated, whereas
      miR-100, let-7i, miR-199a, miR-125b, mir-145 and miR-335 are often down-regulated
      in ovarian cancer compared with normal ovarian tissue. Most mi-RNA signatures are
      overlapping in different tumor histotypes but some mi-RNAs seem to be histotype
      specific. For instance, the endometrioid type shares with the serous and clear
      cell types the up-regulation of miR-200 family members, but also presents
      over-expression of miR-21, miR-202 and miR-205. Clear cell carcinoma has a
      significantly higher expression of miR-30a and miR-30a*, whereas mucinous
      histotype has elevated levels of miR-192/194. In vitro and in vivo investigations
      have shown that several mi-RNAs can modulate the sensitivity of ovarian cancer to
      platinum and taxane, and clinical studies have suggested that mi-RNA profiling
      may predict the outcome of patients with this malignancy. Some mi-RNAs could be
      used as biomarkers to identify patients that might benefit from the addition of
      molecularly targeted agents (i.e. anti-angiogenic agents, MET inhibitors and
      poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors) to standard chemotherapy.
      Moreover, mi-RNAs could represent potential targets for the development of novel 
      therapies.

AB  - Posttranscriptional control of gene expression is crucial for regulating
      plurality of proteins and functional plasticity of the proteome under
      (patho)physiologic conditions. Alternative splicing as well as micro
      (mi)RNA-mediated mechanisms play an important role for the regulation of protein 
      expression on posttranscriptional level. Both alternative splicing and miRNAs
      were shown to influence cardiovascular functions, such as endothelial
      thrombogenicity and the vascular tone, by regulating the expression of several
      vascular proteins and their isoforms, such as Tissue Factor (TF) or the
      endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). This review will summarize and discuss 
      the latest findings on the (patho)physiologic role of alternative splicing
      processes as well as of miRNAs on modulation of vascular functions, such as
      coagulation, thrombosis, and regulation of the vascular tone.

AB  - Recent findings have shown that the blood vessels of different organs exert an
      active role in regulating organ function. In detail, the endothelium that aligns 
      the vasculature of most organs is fundamental in maintaining organ homeostasis
      and in promoting organ recovery following injury. Mechanistically, endothelial
      cells (EC) of tissues such as the liver, lungs or the bone marrow (BM) have been 
      shown to produce "angiocrine" factors that promote organ recovery and restore
      normal organ function. Controlled production of angiocrine factors following
      organ injury is therefore essential to promote organ regeneration and to restore 
      organ function. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the coordinated
      production and function of such "angiocrine" factors are largely undisclosed and 
      were the subject of the present study. In detail, we identified for the first
      time a microRNA (miRNA) expressed by BM EC that regulates the expression of
      angiocrine genes involved in BM recovery following irradiation. Using a
      microarray-based approach, we identified several miRNA expressed by irradiated
      BMEC. After validating the variations in miRNA expression by semi-quantitative
      PCR, we chose to study further the ones showing consistent variations between
      experiments, and those predicted to regulate (directly or indirectly) angiogenic 
      and angiocrine factors. Of the mi-RNA that were chosen, miR-363-5p (previously
      termed miR-363*) was subsequently shown to modulate the expression of numerous
      EC-specific genes including some angiocrine factors. By luciferase reporter
      assays, miR-363-5p is shown to regulate the expression of angiocrine factors
      tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (Timp-1) and thrombospondin 3 (THBS3) at
      post-transcriptional level. Moreover, miR-363-5p reduction using anti-miR is
      shown to affect EC angiogenic properties (such as the response to angiogenic
      factors stimulation) and the interaction between EC and hematopoietic precursors 
      (particularly relevant in a BM setting). miR-363-5p reduction resulted in a
      significant decrease in EC tube formation on matrigel, but increased
      hematopoietic precursor cells adhesion onto EC, a mechanism that is shown to
      involve kit ligand-mediated cell adhesion. Taken together, we have identified a
      miRNA induced by irradiation that regulates angiocrine factors expression on EC
      and as such modulates EC properties. Further studies on the importance of
      miR-363-5p on normal BM function and in disease are warranted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The continuing discovery of new types and functions of small
      non-coding RNAs is suggesting the presence of regulatory mechanisms far more
      complex than the ones currently used to study and design Gene Regulatory
      Networks. Just focusing on the roles of micro RNAs (miRNAs), they have been found
      to be part of several intra-pathway regulatory motifs. However, inter-pathway
      regulatory mechanisms have been often neglected and require further
      investigation. RESULTS: In this paper we present the result of a systems biology 
      study aimed at analyzing a high-level inter-pathway regulatory motif called
      Pathway Protection Loop, not previously described, in which miRNAs seem to play a
      crucial role in the successful behavior and activation of a pathway. Through the 
      automatic analysis of a large set of public available databases, we found
      statistical evidence that this inter-pathway regulatory motif is very common in
      several classes of KEGG Homo Sapiens pathways and concurs in creating a complex
      regulatory network involving several pathways connected by this specific motif.
      The role of this motif seems also confirmed by a deeper review of other research 
      activities on selected representative pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Although previous
      studies suggested transcriptional regulation mechanism at the pathway level such 
      as the Pathway Protection Loop, a high-level analysis like the one proposed in
      this paper is still missing. The understanding of higher-level regulatory motifs 
      could, as instance, lead to new approaches in the identification of therapeutic
      targets because it could unveil new and "indirect" paths to activate or silence a
      target pathway. However, a lot of work still needs to be done to better uncover
      this high-level inter-pathway regulation including enlarging the analysis to
      other small non-coding RNA molecules.

PG  - e70515
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0070515 [doi]
AB  - A significant role for micro (mi)RNA in the regulation of gene expression in
      tumours has been recently established. In order to further understand how miRNA
      expression may contribute to prostate tumour growth and progression, we evaluated
      expression of miRNA in two invasive prostate tumour lines, PC3 and DU145, and
      compared it to that in normal prostate epithelial cells. Although a number of
      miRNAs were differentially expressed, we focused our analysis on miR-105, a novel
      miRNA not previously linked to prostate cancer. miR-105 levels were significantly
      decreased in both tumour cell lines in comparison to normal prostate epithelial
      cells. To determine its potential role in prostate cancer pathogenesis, we
      overexpressed miR-105 in both PC3 and DU145 cells and determined its effect on
      various tumourigenic properties. miR-105 overexpression inhibited tumour cell
      proliferation, tumour growth in anchorage-independent three-dimensional
      conditions and tumour invasion in vitro, properties of highly aggressive tumour
      cells. Of potential clinical significance, miR-105 overexpression inhibited
      tumour growth in vivo in xenograft models using these cell lines. We further
      identified CDK6 as a putative target of miR-105 which is likely a main
      contributor to the inhibition of tumour cell growth observed in our assays. Our
      results suggest that miR-105 inhibits tumour cell proliferation and hence may
      represent a novel therapeutically relevant cellular target to inhibit tumour
      growth or a marker of aggressive tumours in prostate cancer patients.

AB  - In mammals, adult neural stem cells give rise to new hippocampal dentate granule 
      neurons and interneurons of the olfactory bulb throughout life. The microtubule
      associated protein Doublecortin (DCX) is expressed by migrating neuroblasts and
      immature neurons, and is widely used as a stage-specific marker of adult
      neurogenesis and as a marker to identify neurogenic activity in the adult brain
      per se. Mutations in the DCX gene have been causally linked to human
      lissencephalic syndromes. Moreover, embryonic loss of DCX function interferes
      with neuronal migration and dendritic patterning in a species- and
      region-specific manner. A putative function of DCX in adult neurogenesis has not 
      been directly explored. Here we show that overexpression of DCX in newly
      generated dentate granule neurons of the adult mouse brain has no effect on
      morphological maturation or migration. We also show that micro (mi) RNA-mediated 
      retroviral knockdown of DCX does not alter morphological maturation of adult born
      dentate granule cells or migration of new neurons in either adult neurogenic
      niche. Thus, the present data indicate that DCX is dispensable for the
      development of new neurons in adult mice.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) accounts for>90% oral cancer
      which is a leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Early diagnosis may well
      offer an opportunity to increase survival to this neoplasm.
      Micro(mi)RNA-interfered cancer progression is crucial, yet its migration
      machinery of OSCC is still unknown. To access whether the possible miRNA
      prognostic markers and underlying mechanisms, we developed a highly migratory
      TW2.6 MS-10 cells from TW2.6 cells to investigate the issue. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: miRNA profiling was performed on TW2.6 and TW2.6 MS-10. Target miRNA was
      correlated to pathological status in OSCC patients by real-time RT-PCR. A
      downstream effector was identified using a bioinformatics analysis, and a
      3'-untranslated region (UTR) reporter assay was used. RESULTS: An miRNA cluster, 
      miR-17-92, including miR-17, miR-19b, miR-20a, and miR-92a, was found to be
      significantly down-regulated in TW2.6 MS-10 compared to TW2.6 cells.
      Overexpression of this cluster decreased the migratory ability of OSCC cell
      lines. We further demonstrated that miR-17 and miR-20a are the main miRNAs of
      miR-17-92 cluster which modulate OSCC migration. Clinically, miR-17/20a showed
      negative correlation with TNM stage and lymphatic metastasis. Through a
      bioinformatics screening analysis and 3'UTR reporter assay, we confirmed the
      integrin (ITG) beta8 as a direct target of miR-17/20a, and knockdown of ITGbeta8 
      reduced cell migratory capability of OSCC. CONCLUSIONS: miR-17/20a acts as a
      prognostic predictor of OSCC patients' outcome and a tumor migration suppressor
      miRNA.

TI  - Endometrial exosomes/microvesicles in the uterine microenvironment: a new
      paradigm for embryo-endometrial cross talk at implantation.
PG  - e58502
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0058502 [doi]
AB  - Exosomes are nanoparticles ( approximately 100 nm diameter) released from cells, 
      which can transfer small RNAs and mRNA via the extracellular environment to cells
      at distant sites. We hypothesised that exosomes or the slightly larger
      microvesicles (100-300 nm) are released from the endometrial epithelium into the 
      uterine cavity, and that these contain specific micro (mi)RNA that could be
      transferred to either the trophectodermal cells of the blastocyst or to
      endometrial epithelial cells, to promote implantation. The aim of this study was 
      to specifically identify and characterise exosomes/microvesicles (mv) released
      from endometrial epithelial cells and to determine whether exosomes/mv are
      present in uterine fluid. Immunostaining demonstrated that the tetraspanins, CD9 
      and CD63 used as cell surface markers of exosomes are present on the apical
      surfaces of endometrial epithelial cells in tissue sections taken across the
      menstrual cycle: CD63 showed cyclical regulation. Exosome/mv pellets were
      prepared from culture medium of endometrial epithelial cell (ECC1 cells) and from
      uterine fluid and its associated mucus by sequential ultracentifugation.
      Exosomes/mv were positively identified in all preparations by FACS and
      immunofluorescence staining following exosome binding to beads. Size particle
      analysis confirmed the predominance of particles of 50-150 nm in each of these
      fluids. MiRNA analysis of the ECC1 cells and their exosomes/mv demonstrated
      sorting of miRNA into exosomes/mv: 13 of the 227 miRNA were specific to
      exosomes/mv, while a further 5 were not present in these. The most abundant miRNA
      in exosomes/mv were hsa-miR-200c, hsa-miR-17 and hsa-miR-106a. Bioinformatic
      analysis showed that the exosome/mv-specific miRNAs have potential targets in
      biological pathways highly relevant for embryo implantation. Thus exosomes/mv
      containing specific miRNA are present in the microenvironment in which embryo
      implantation occurs and may contribute to the endometrial-embryo cross talk
      essential for this process.

AB  - The combination of two silent mutations, c.1311C>T in exon 11 and IVS11 T93C
      (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) 1311T/93C), with unknown mechanism,
      have been reported in G6PD-deficient individuals in Asian populations including
      Malaysian aboriginal group, Negrito. Here, we report the screening of G6PD gene
      in 103 Negrito volunteers using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography
      (dHPLC) and direct sequencing. A total of 48 individuals (46.6%) were G6PD
      deficient, 83.3% of these carried G6PD 1311T/93C with enzyme activity ranging
      from 1.8 to 4.8 U gHb(-1). Three novel single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs),
      rs112950723, rs111485003 and rs1050757, were found in the G6PD 3'-untranslated
      region (UTR). Strong association was observed between haplotype 1311T/93C and
      rs1050757G, which is located inside the 35 bp AG-rich region. In silico analysis 
      revealed that the transition of A to G at position rs1050757 makes significant
      changes in the G6PD mRNA secondary structure. Moreover, putative micro (mi)RNA
      target sites were identified in 3'-UTR of G6PD gene, two of these in the region
      encompassing rs1050757. It could be speculated that rs1050757 have a potential
      functional effect on the downregulation of mRNA and consequently G6PD deficiency 
      either by affecting mRNA stability and translation or mirRNA regulation process. 
      This is the first report of biochemical association of an SNP in 3'-UTR of G6PD
      gene and the possible role of mRNA secondary structure.

TI  - Identification of a set of miRNAs differentially expressed in transiently
      TIA-depleted HeLa cells by genome-wide profiling.
PG  - 4
LID - 10.1186/1471-2199-14-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: T-cell intracellular antigen (TIA) proteins function as regulators of
      cell homeostasis. These proteins control gene expression globally at multiple
      levels in response to dynamic regulatory changes and environmental stresses.
      Herein we identified a micro(mi)RNA signature associated to transiently
      TIA-depleted HeLa cells and analyzed the potential role of miRNAs combining
      genome-wide analysis data on mRNA and miRNA profiles. RESULTS: Using
      high-throughput miRNA expression profiling, transient depletion of TIA-proteins
      in HeLa cells was observed to promote significant and reproducible changes
      affecting to a pool of up-regulated miRNAs involving miR-30b-3p, miR125a-3p,
      miR-193a-5p, miR-197-3p, miR-203a, miR-210, miR-371-5p, miR-373-5p, miR-483-5p,
      miR-492, miR-498, miR-503-5p, miR-572, miR-586, miR-612, miR-615-3p, miR-623,
      miR-625-5p, miR-629-5p, miR-638, miR-658, miR-663a, miR-671-5p, miR-769-3p and
      miR-744-5p. Some up-regulated and unchanged miRNAs were validated and previous
      results confirmed by reverse transcription and real time PCR. By target
      prediction of the miRNAs and combined analysis of the genome-wide expression
      profiles identified in TIA-depleted HeLa cells, we detected connections between
      up-regulated miRNAs and potential target genes. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto
      Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database analysis suggest that target
      genes are related with biological processes associated to the regulation of
      DNA-dependent transcription, signal transduction and multicellular organismal
      development as well as with the enrichment of pathways involved in cancer, focal 
      adhesion, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, endocytosis and MAPK and Wnt
      signaling pathways, respectively. When the collection of experimentally defined
      differentially expressed genes in TIA-depleted HeLa cells was intersected with
      potential target genes only 7 out of 68 (10%) up- and 71 out of 328 (22%)
      down-regulated genes were shared. GO and KEGG database analyses showed that the
      enrichment categories of biological processes and cellular pathways were related 
      with innate immune response, signal transduction, response to interleukin-1,
      glomerular basement membrane development as well as neuroactive ligand-receptor
      interaction, endocytosis, lysosomes and apoptosis, respectively. CONCLUSION: All 
      this considered, these observations suggest that individual miRNAs could act as
      potential mediators of the epigenetic switch linking transcriptomic dynamics and 
      cell phenotypes mediated by TIA proteins.

TI  - [Hazard identification and risk evaluation in the metal industry: the epigenetic 
      challenge].
PG  - 223-8
AB  - The contribution of scientific knowledge to workplace health and safety measures 
      is becoming more and more relevant. To identify hazards, an increasing number of 
      mechanistic markers (of exposure, of effect, of individual susceptibility) are
      now available. To be effective, prevention measures should take into
      consideration not just the hazards, but also the risk which may vary among
      different populations and across individuals exposed to the same hazard. A new,
      extremely promising class of molecular markers of gene-environment interaction
      comes from epigenetics research (e.g., DNA methylation, histone modification,
      mi-RNA). A recent epigenetic epidemiology study in workers exposed to metals and 
      PM in the metal industry disclosed their potential role as predictor of extremely
      early effects on gene expression regulating inflammation and blood coagulation
      function. A possible, worrisome development in applying mechanistic knowledge in 
      exposure monitoring and exposed individuals' surveillance is to divert the
      attention from the control of exposure and put the focus on the screening of
      susceptible individuals only. This raises ethical, social and legal issues which 
      may ultimately impact throughout the practice of occupational and environmental
      health.

AB  - To study the effect of micro (mi)RNA on cellular proliferation induced by
      hepatitis B x protein, HBx, in human liver cells and to investigate the
      underlying molecular mechanism of this cancer-related effect. The human L02
      hepatocyte cell line was stably transfected with HBx (L02/HBx) or an HBx mutant
      (L02/HBx-d382) that induces higher levels of cellular proliferation. The
      differential miRNA expression profiles were determined by microarray analysis and
      confirmed by real-time PCR. Two miRNAs, miR-338-3p and miR-551b, that were found 
      to be significantly down-regulated in the L02/HBx-d382 cells were selected for
      further study and transfected individually into cells using the lipofectamine
      procedure. The cell survival rate was analyzed by MTT assay, and cell cycles were
      assessed by flow cytometry. Expressions of cyclinD1, cyclinG1, and E2F1 were
      assessed by real-time PCR and Western blotting. Compared with the microarray
      miRNA profile of L02/pcDNA3.0 cells, six miRNAs were up-regulated and five miRNAs
      were down-regulated in the L02/HBx-d382 cells, while four miRNAs were
      up-regulated and 12 were down-regulated in the L02/HBx cells. The microarray
      results were consistent with real-time PCR results. Transfection of miR-338-3p
      and miR-551b significantly inhibited the cell survival rates (P less than 0.001) 
      and induced G0/G1 phase cycle arrest. According to MTT results: for L02/HBx-d382 
      cells, compared with lipofectamine or non-transfected (NC) controls, the t value 
      of miR-338-3p was 10.402, 9.133 and the t value of miR-551b was 8.763, 7.403; for
      L02/HBx cells, compared with lipofectamine or NC controls, the t value of
      miR-338-3p was 9.105, 8.074 and the t value of miR-551b was 7.673, 7.52.
      According to flow cytometry results: for L02/HBx-d382 cells, compared with
      lipofectamine or NC controls, the t value of miR-338-3p was 12.173, 11.107 and
      the t value of miR-551b was 15.364, 13.377; for L02/HBx cells, compared with
      lipofectamine or NC controls, the t value of miR-338-3p was 15.416, 13.378, and
      the t value of miR-551b was 13.276, 13.109. The protein levels of cyclinD1,
      cyclinG1, and E2F1 were significantly reduced by both miR-338-3p and miR-551b ( P
      less than 0.001). For L02/HBx-d382 cells, compared with lipofectamine or NC
      controls: E2F1 had t = 11.132, 10.031 and 12.017, 10.973, respectively; cyclinD1 
      had t = 15.654, 15.013 and 15.447, 14.733, respectively; cyclinG1 had t = 8.017, 
      7.661 and 7.402, 7.417, respectively. For L02/HBx cells, compared with
      lipofectamine or NC controls: E2F1 had t = 14.244, 13.331 and 15.022, 14.468,
      respectively; cyclinD1 had t = 8.695, 8.137 and 7.877, 7.503, respectively;
      cyclinG1 had t = 7.73, 7.471 and 7.596, 7.41, respectively. In contrast, the mRNA
      levels for E2F1, cyclinD1, and cylcinG1 showed no significant differences between
      the miRNA transfected cells and controls. Wild-type HBx and the high
      proliferation-inducing mutant HBx can influence the miRNA expression profile of
      L02 cells. HBx down-regulates miR-338-3p and miR-551b in L02 cells, and the high 
      proliferation-inducing mutant has a more robust effect. The mechanism of
      miR-338-3p- or miR-551b-mediated cell growth inhibition appears to be related to 
      the direct modulation of cyclinD1, cyclinG1, and E2F1.

      studies show that tobacco products can alter the miRNA profiles in lung
      epithelial cells. However, the molecular alterations occurring in oral
      fibroblasts exposed to tobacco constituents remain to be elucidated. METHODS:
      Oral fibroblasts were exposed to cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) and miRNA
      expression compared to untreated controls using tiling low-density arrays (TLDA).
      Expression of miRNA-145 was confirmed by quantitative (q)RT-PCR. The effect of
      CSC on fibroblast cell viability, motility and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2
      expression was measured using MTS, a wound scratch assay and qRT-PCR,
      respectively. Oral cancer cell migration in response to culture supernatants from
      mock, control or pre-miR-145-transfected CSC-treated fibroblasts was analysed by 
      chemotaxis assay. RESULTS: TLDA analysis identified widespread changes in the
      miRNA expression profile of fibroblasts exposed to CSC. Pri-, pre- and mature
      miRNA-145 were significantly down-regulated in response to CSC, and this was
      accompanied by up-regulated expression of MMP-2 and increased migration of
      fibroblasts compared to untreated controls. Re-expression of miR-145 abrogated
      the ability of fibroblasts to promote oral cancer cell chemotaxis in response to 
      CSC. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that tobacco constituents influence the
      expression of miRNA within oral fibroblasts promoting a phenotype that increases 
      oral cancer migration and sheds new light on the mechanisms underlying oral
      cancer pathogenesis.

AB  - Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC) can be differentiated into
      lung epithelial-like cells (MSC-EC) in vitro. The response of BM-MSC and MSC-EC
      to stimuli may vary because of their character and differentiation. We aimed to
      investigate the factors that may influence in vitro differentiation of BM-MSC to 
      MSC-EC. We determined the response of BM-MSC, MSC-EC, bronchial epithelial cells,
      and alveolar epithelial cells to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha stimulation.
      We also investigated the changes in micro(mi)RNA-146a, miRNA-155, and TNF
      receptor 1 (TNFR1) expression after stimulation. Our results demonstrate that the
      addition of transforming growth factor-beta(1) and extracellular matrix collagen 
      are required to facilitate such differentiation. After 3 weeks of culture, the
      morphological appearance and expression of airway epithelial markers, cytokeratin
      and Clara cell secretory protein, in MSC-EC were characteristics of lung
      epithelial cells. In response to TNF-alpha stimulation, the maximal interleukin
      (IL)-8 production by BM-MSC at the 24-h time point was 4.8 times greater compared
      with MSC-EC. TNF-alpha induced a significant increase in the expression of
      miRNA-146a in BM-MSC as compared with MSC-EC. miRNA-155 expression remained
      unchanged after stimulation. TNFR1 mRNA also significantly increased in BM-MSC
      after TNF-alpha stimulation. This was not observed in MSC-EC. Transfection with
      miRNA-146a mimics resulted in a significant increase of miRNA-146a expression and
      IL-8 production in both types of cells. In contrast, miRNA-146a inhibitors
      reduced miRNA-146a expression and IL-8 production. Overexpression of miRNA-146a, 
      which positively regulates TNF-alpha-induced IL-8 release, may enhance the
      inflammatory response in both BM-MSC and MSC-EC. The expression of miRNA-146a and
      the response to stimuli may be modulated through mature differentiation of
      BM-MSC.

TI  - Diagnostic microRNA markers to screen for sporadic human colon cancer in blood.
PG  - 179-92
AB  - We carried out this study to present proof-of-principal application, showing that
      by using a global microarray expression analysis, followed by quantitative
      stem-loop reverse transcriptase in conjunction with TaqMan(R) polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR) analysis of micro(mi)RNA genes, on limited number of plasma and
      tissue samples obtained from 20 individuals (five healthy, five TNM stage 0-1
      colon cancer, five stage 2 and five stage 3), we were able to quantitatively
      monitor miRNA changes at the various TNM stages of colon cancer progression,
      particularly at the early, pre-malignant adenoma stage (e.g. polyps >/= 1 cm with
      high grade dysplasia). The expression of some of the tested miRNAs showed less
      variability in tissue than in plasma. Nevertheless, our limited preliminary data 
      on the plasma by itself show that plasma is well-suited for screening, and that
      the quantitative changes in the expression of a few cell-free circulatory mature 
      miRNA molecules in plasma, that are associated with colon cancer progression,
      would provide for more sensitive and specific markers than those tests currently 
      available on the market. In addition, analysis of miRNA molecules offers a
      quantitative and cost-effective non-invasive diagnostic approach for screening,
      than currently employed methods in a prevalent cancer that can be cured if it is 
      detected at the early TNM stages, and that becomes deadly if not diagnosed before
      metastasis. Thus, a larger prospective and properly randomized clinical study
      using plasma derived from many control individuals and at various stages of colon
      cancer (TNM stages 0-IV) from patients, in order to corroborate the initial
      results, is now urgently needed in order to allow for a statistically valid
      analysis, standardizing test conditions which will provide a means for
      determining the true sensitivity and specificity of a miRNA-screening approach.
      This approach, when combined with bioinformatics analysis to correlate miRNA seed
      data with mRNA target data, would allow for a mechanistic understanding of how
      miRNAs regulate mRNA gene expression, and would offer a better comprehensive
      diagnostic screening test for early-detection of colon cancer non-invasively.

TI  - Potential role of garcinol as an anticancer agent.
PG  - 647206
LID - 10.1155/2012/647206 [doi]
AB  - Garcinol, a polyisoprenylated benzophenone, is extracted from the rind of the
      fruit of Garcinia indica, a plant found extensively in tropical regions. Although
      the fruit has been consumed traditionally over centuries, its biological
      activities, specifically its anticancer potential is a result of recent
      scientific investigations. The anticarcinogenic properties of garcinol appear to 
      be moderated via its antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, antiangiogenic, and
      proapoptotic activities. In addition, garcinol displays effective epigenetic
      influence by inhibiting histone acetyltransferases (HAT 300) and by possible
      posttranscriptional modulation by mi RNA profiles involved in carcinogenesis. In 
      vitro as well as some in vivo studies have shown the potential of this compound
      against several cancers types including breast, colon, pancreatic, and leukemia. 
      Although this is a promising molecule in terms of its anticancer properties,
      investigations in relevant animal models, and subsequent human trials are
      warranted in order to fully appreciate and confirm its chemopreventative and/or
      therapeutic potential.

      frequently studied in cancer research and aging. DNA methylation, mi-RNA, and
      histones deacetylation are investigated in different pathologies, including
      inflammatory diseases and age-related diseases such as osteoarthritis (OA). In
      this review, we focus on the chromatin-modifying enzymes in arthritic
      pathologies, and more particularly on Sirtuins. We also review the role of Sirt1 
      in OA, which has been highlighted in recent publications, and examine the
      possible protective role Sirt1 could play in this disease. Moreover, we discuss
      the possible therapeutic target of such a protein, reviewing the potential
      inhibitors/activators of this enzyme and their properties.

      RNA sequencing.
PG  - 327-35
LID - 10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.111.961631 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The left and right atria have different susceptibilities toward
      developing arrhythmias, with left atrial arrhythmias more commonly observed. To
      understand the molecular basis for such differences, we catalogued micro (mi)RNA 
      and mRNA expression differences by next generation sequencing. METHODS AND
      RESULTS: Four human left-right atrial pairs were subjected to whole-genome
      expression analyses via next-generation sequencing of small RNAs, including
      miRNAs, and poly-A-enriched mRNAs. Using a paired sample design, significant
      differences in the expression of 32 miRNAs were found in between the left and
      right atria at a probability value of <0.01. Hsa-miR-143 was the most highly
      expressed miRNA in the atria, as quantified by RNA sequencing. There were 746 and
      2292 differentially expressed mRNAs between the left and right atria at false
      discovery rates of <0.001 and <0.05, respectively. Transcription factor binding
      elements within 2 kb of RefSeq genes were determined and specific motifs were
      identified that were enriched in differentially expressed genes. Similarly,
      specific miRNA target sequences in 3' UTRs were also enriched in differentially
      expressed genes. In addition, 11 novel noncoding RNAs of unknown function were
      found to be differentially expressed between the left and right atria.
      CONCLUSIONS: There are significant differences in miRNA and mRNA expression
      profiles between the left and right atria, which may yield insight into increased
      the arrhythmogenesis of the left atria.

PG  - 598-602
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To screen the mi-RNA expression profile after interferon treatment in 
      cells infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). METHODS: Huh-7.5.1 cells was
      infected with HCV by in vitro transcription and cultured with interferon. The
      mi-RNA microarray was used to measure the mi-RNA expression in the control group,
      HCV transcription group and interference group. Intra-group differences were
      analyzed by the 2 ((-delt delt CT)) method. RESULTS: With mi-RNA expressed in
      normal Huh-7.5.1 cells as a benchmark, expressions of 13 kinds of mi-RNAs were
      up-regulated after HCV infection and then down-regulated following interferon
      treatment; 7 were down-regulated after HCV infection and then up-regulated
      following interferon treatment. CONCLUSION: mi-RNA10a, mi-RNA21, mi-RNA149,
      mi-RNA152 and mi-RNA210 may be related to hepatitis C virus replication and
      transcription.

AB  - In many RNA silencing applications, there is a benefit to expressing multiple
      interfering RNAs simultaneously. This can be achieved by using a single RNA
      polymerase II promoter to express multiple micro(mi)RNA-formatted interfering
      RNAs that are arranged in a polycistronic cluster, mimicking the organization of 
      naturally clustered, endogenous miRNAs. While RNA pol III promoters are often
      used to express individual short hairpin (sh) RNAs, we have recently shown that
      pol III promoters can also be used to drive polycistronic expression of
      miRNA-formatted interfering RNAs. Here, we present methods for the assembly of
      polycistronic miRNA expression vectors that use pol III promoters. In addition,
      we present methods for testing the potency and the level of expression of each of
      the individual miRNAs encoded in the construct.

TI  - Circulating miR-142-3p levels in patients with systemic sclerosis.
PG  - 34-9
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2230.2011.04158.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently, increased evidence has shown that serum micro (mi)RNA
      levels are a useful biomarker for the diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic value 
      of various diseases. However, serum miRNA has not been investigated in patients
      with systemic sclerosis (SSc), to our knowledge. AIM: To investigate the
      possibility that serum levels of Homo sapiens miR-142 stem-loop (hsa-miR-142-3p),
      one of the miRNAs regulating the expression of integrin alphaV, could be a
      specific disease marker for SSc. METHODS: Serum samples were obtained from 61
      patients with SSc and 20 healthy controls. Patients with systemic lupus
      erythematosus (SLE), dermatomyositis (DM) and scleroderma spectrum disorder
      (SSD), who did not fulfil American College of Rheumatology criteria for SSc but
      might develop SSc in the future, were included as disease controls in this study.
      miRNAs were purified from serum, and miR-142-3p levels were measured with a
      quantitative real-time PCR assay. RESULTS: Serum miR-142-3p levels in patients
      with SSc were significantly higher than in patients with SSD, SLE or DM, and
      healthy control groups. Patients with increased miR-142-3p levels tended to have 
      a short sublingual frenulum. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that serum levels of 
      miR-142-3p may be elevated specifically in patients with SSc, correlating with
      the severity of this disease, and may be useful diagnostic markers for the
      presence of SSc and for the differentiation of SSc from SSD.

TI  - Off-target effects dominate a large-scale RNAi screen for modulators of the
      TGF-beta pathway and reveal microRNA regulation of TGFBR2.
PG  - 3
LID - 10.1186/1758-907X-2-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: RNA interference (RNAi) screens have been used to identify novel
      components of signal-transduction pathways in a variety of organisms. We
      performed a small interfering (si)RNA screen for novel members of the
      transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta pathway in a human keratinocyte cell line. 
      The TGF-beta pathway is integral to mammalian cell proliferation and survival,
      and aberrant TGF-beta responses have been strongly implicated in cancer. RESULTS:
      We assayed how strongly single siRNAs targeting each of 6,000 genes affect the
      nuclear translocation of a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-SMAD2 reporter fusion 
      protein. Surprisingly, we found no novel TGF-beta pathway members, but we did
      find dominant off-target effects. All siRNA hits, whatever their intended direct 
      target, reduced the mRNA levels of two known upstream pathway components, the
      TGF-beta receptors 1 and 2 (TGFBR1 and TGFBR2), via micro (mi)RNA-like off-target
      effects. The scale of these off-target effects was remarkable, with at least 1%
      of the sequences in the unbiased siRNA library having measurable off-target
      effects on one of these two genes. It seems that relatively minor reductions of
      message levels via off-target effects can have dominant effects on an assay, if
      the pathway output is very dose-sensitive to levels of particular pathway
      components. In search of mechanistic details, we identified multiple miRNA-like
      sequence characteristics that correlated with the off-target effects. Based on
      these results, we identified miR-20a, miR-34a and miR-373 as miRNAs that inhibit 
      TGFBR2 expression. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings point to potential improvements for 
      miRNA/siRNA target prediction methods, and suggest that the type II TGF-beta
      receptor is regulated by multiple miRNAs. We also conclude that the risk of
      obtaining misleading results in siRNA screens using large libraries with
      single-assay readout is substantial. Control and rescue experiments are essential
      in the interpretation of such screens, and improvements to the methods to reduce 
      or predict RNAi off-target effects would be beneficial.

TI  - Micro(mi)RNA expression profile of breast cancer epithelial cells treated with
      the anti-diabetic drug metformin: induction of the tumor suppressor miRNA let-7a 
      and suppression of the TGFbeta-induced oncomiR miRNA-181a.
PG  - 1144-51
AB  - An unexplored molecular scenario that might explain the inhibitory impact of the 
      anti-diabetic drug metformin on the genesis of breast cancer relates to
      metformin's ability to modulate the expression status of micro (mi)RNAs. We here 
      report the first miRNA expression profiling of human epithelial breast cancer
      cells cultured in the presence of metformin. We conducted real-time transcription
      polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) Arrays to quantitatively compare the
      expression profile of 88 cancer-related miRNA sequences before and after
      treatment of MCF-7 cells, which were used as well-differentiated, epithelioid
      cell controls, with graded concentrations of metformin. Metformin-treated MCF-7
      cells notably exhibited up to 18-fold increases in miRNA lethal-7a (let-7a)
      expression compared with untreated control cells. We confirmed that MCF-7 cells
      undergoing epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) transition in response to the cytokine
      TGFbeta notably up-regulated (~5-fold) miRNA-181a expression and exhibited better
      mammosphere-forming capabilities. We then explored the ability of metformin to
      impede TGFbeta-enhanced propensity of breast cancer stem cells to form
      mammospheres in a miRNA-181a-related manner. Remarkably, TGFbeta treatment failed
      to up-regulate miRNA-181a expression in the presence of metformin, which was able
      to fully abrogate TGFbeta-enhanced mammosphere-forming ability. In addition,
      metformin co-treatment fully prevented TGFbeta-induced down-regulation of the
      tumor suppressor miRNA-96 (~10-fold). Metformin's molecular functioning to
      prevent invasive breast cancer can be explained in terms of its previously
      unrecognized ability to efficiently up-regulate the tumor-suppressive miRNAs
      let-7a & miRNA-96 and inhibit the oncogenic miRNA-181a, thus epigenetically
      preserving the differentiated phenotype of mammary epithelium while preventing
      EMT-related cancer-initiating cell self-renewal.

TI  - Transforming growth factor-beta regulates the sphere-initiating stem cell-like
      feature in breast cancer through miRNA-181 and ATM.
PG  - 1470-80
LID - 10.1038/onc.2010.531 [doi]
AB  - Recent studies indicate that a subset of cancer cells possessing stem cell
      properties, referred to as cancer-initiating or cancer stem cells (CSCs), have
      crucial roles in tumor initiation, metastasis and resistance to anticancer
      therapies. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta and their family members have
      been implicated in both normal (embryonic and somatic) stem cells and CSCs. In
      this study, we observed that exposure to TGF-beta increased the population of
      breast cancer (BC) cells that can form mammospheres in suspension, a feature
      endowed by stem cells. This was mediated by the micro (mi)RNA family miR-181,
      which was upregulated by TGF-beta at the post-transcriptional level. Levels of
      the miR-181 family members were elevated in mammospheres grown in
      undifferentiating conditions, compared with cells grown in two-dimensional
      conditions. Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), a target gene of miR-181,
      exhibited reduced expression in mammospheres and upon TGF-beta treatment.
      Overexpression of miR-181a/b, or depletion of ATM or its substrate CHK2, was
      sufficient to induce sphere formation in BC cells. Finally, knockdown of ATM
      enhanced in vivo tumorigenesis of the MDA361 BC cells. Our results elucidate a
      novel mechanism through which the TGF-beta pathway regulates the CSC property by 
      interfering with the tumor suppressor ATM, providing insights into the cellular
      and environmental factors regulating CSCs, which may guide future studies on
      therapeutic strategies targeting these cells.

TI  - Exosomes: Fit to deliver small RNA.
PG  - 447-50
LID - 10.4161/cib.3.5.12339 [doi]
AB  - Exosomes are specialized membranous nano-sized vesicles derived from endocytic
      compartments that are released by many cell types. Microvesicles are distinctive 
      from exosomes in that they are produced by shedding of the plasmamembrane and
      usually larger in size (>1 microm). Exosome biogenesis involves the tightly
      controlled process of inward budding from the limiting membrane of multivesicular
      bodies (MVBs). This results in numerous intraluminal vesicles in the lumen of
      MVBs that contain distinct protein repertoires. It has been suggested that
      microvesicles shed by certain tumor cells hold functional messenger RNA (mRNA)
      that may promote tumor progression. We discovered that purified exosomes contain 
      functional microRNAs (miRNAs) and small RNA, but detected little mRNA. Although a
      clear and decisive distinction between microvesicles and exosomes cannot be made 
      and different subsets of exosomes exist, we speculate that exosomes are
      specialized in carrying small RNA including the class 22-25 nucleotide regulatory
      miRNAs. To demonstrate this we developed a co-culture system and found that
      exosomes are continuously secreted and transferred from Epstein Barr virus
      (EBV)-infected cells to uninfected neighboring cells. Throughout exosome
      transfer, the exogenous EBV-encoded miRNAs were delivered to subcellular sites of
      miRNA-mediated gene repression. Additionally, we found evidence that mature
      miRNAs are transferred between circulating cells in humans, since we detected
      EBV-miRNAs in non-infected cells in the peripheral blood of patients that include
      monocytes and T cells. In this addendum we discuss these findings in the context 
      of recently published papers that advanced our current knowledge of exosome
      physiology, (mi)RNA function and intercellular RNA transfer. Based on this
      information we propose that an intercellular (miRNA-based) mode of signal
      transmission may be well suited in controlling space-confined processes such as
      the initiation of immune responses in the secondary (peripheral) lymphoid tissues
      or in a tumor microenvironment. Deciphering the molecular mechanism(s) that
      control small RNA loading into exosomes and transfer to recipient cells in vitro 
      will provide new evidence for the physiological relevance of vesicle-mediated
      intercellular communication in vivo.

AB  - MicroRNAs are a class of small non-coding RNAs widely reported in eukaryotic
      multicellular organisms. In this study, a number of small non-coding micro
      (mi)RNA species in clinical isolates of prokaryote Pseudomonas aeruginosa were
      obtained from the sputum of adult patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) utilising a 
      DynaExpress miRNA cloning kit, and five miRNAs of 16-47 nucleotides that were
      smaller than those encountered or described (80-100 nucleotides) previously in
      bacterial systems were described. This report presents data on these unknown
      cellular miRNAs cloned from P. aeruginosa isolates from CF patients. Adapting a
      computational miRNA prediction model that takes advantage of the highly conserved
      known miRNA hair pin stems regions, the results revealed that the fold structure 
      of the microRNAs had a high homology to the recently reported human bacterial
      infection response (BiR)-related microRNA, mi-146, associated with the Toll-like 
      receptor (TLR) family, which is the primary evolutionarily conserved sensors of
      pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and known to trigger host
      inflammatory and immune responses.

PG  - 148-58

AB  - The discovery that somatic cells can be reprogrammed to become induced
      pluripotent stem (iPS) cells has ushered in a new and exciting era in
      regenerative medicine. Since the seminal discovery of somatic cell reprogramming 
      by Takahashi and Yamanaka in 2006, there has been remarkable progress in the
      characterization of iPS cells and the protocols used to generate them. The new
      information generated during the past year alone has vastly expanded our
      understanding of these cells. Accordingly, this review provides a basic overview 
      of the different strategies used to generate iPS cells and focuses on recent
      developments in the field of iPS cells. In the final section, we discuss three
      broad, unanswered questions related to somatic cell reprogramming, which are just
      starting to be addressed.

PG  - 215-23
LID - 10.1016/j.tim.2010.01.001 [doi]
AB  - In the past three years, remarkable discoveries have added three new human
      polyomaviruses (KI virus (KIV), WU virus (WUV) and Merkel cell virus (MCV)) to a 
      class that previously had only two disease-causing members (BK virus (BKV) and JC
      virus (JCV)) identified. Two monkey polyomaviruses, simian virus (SV)40 and
      B-cell lymphotropic polyomavirus (LPV) are also present in humans. KIV and WUV
      lack the agnoprotein coding sequence and regulatory micro (mi)RNA clusters of
      BKV, JCV and SV40. MCV lacks the agnoprotein sequence but generates miRNAs. KIV, 
      WUV and MCV are all widespread in humans. Although they have distinctive tissue
      tropisms, all these viruses are probably acquired in childhood. Of these viruses,
      only MCV has thus far been strongly linked to cancer. Marshalled evidence from
      diverse sources implicates MCV as an etiological agent of Merkel cell carcinoma. 
      This review compares the structural features of the new and previously known
      polyomaviruses, with the aim of identifying approaches to molecular pathology.

TI  - Mi-DISCOVERER: A bioinformatics tool for the detection of mi-RNA in human genome.
PG  - 271-6
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 22 nucleotides non-coding RNAs that play pivotal
      regulatory roles in diverse organisms including the humans and are difficult to
      be identified due to lack of either sequence features or robust algorithms to
      efficiently identify. Therefore, we made a tool that is Mi-Discoverer for the
      detection of miRNAs in human genome. The tools used for the development of
      software are Microsoft Office Access 2003, the JDK version 1.6.0, BioJava version
      1.0, and the NetBeans IDE version 6.0. All already made miRNAs softwares were web
      based; so the advantage of our project was to make a desktop facility to the user
      for sequence alignment search with already identified miRNAs of human genome
      present in the database. The user can also insert and update the newly discovered
      human miRNA in the database. Mi-Discoverer, a bioinformatics tool successfully
      identifies human miRNAs based on multiple sequence alignment searches. It's a non
      redundant database containing a large collection of publicly available human
      miRNAs.

TI  - Diagnostic microRNA markers for screening sporadic human colon cancer and active 
      ulcerative colitis in stool and tissue.
PG  - 281-95
AB  - By routinely and systematically being able to perform quantitative stem-loop
      reverse transcriptase followed by TaqMan PCR expression analysis on stool and
      tissue samples using fifteen human (Homo sapiens, hsa) micro(mi)RNA genes
      selected by careful analysis of the peer-reviewed literature, we were able to
      monitor changes at various stages of CRC, allowing for reliable diagnostic
      screening of colon cancer particularly at the early, pre-malignant stages, and
      for difficult-to-treat active ulcerative colitis (UC). Although the expression of
      some of the miRNA genes tested in tissue showed less variability in CRC or UC
      patients than in stool, the stool by itself appears well-suited to screening. A
      miRNA approach using stool samples promises to offer more sensitivity and
      specificity than currently used screening genomic, methylomic or proteomic
      methods for colon cancer. Larger prospective clinical studies utilizing stool
      derived from many control, colon cancer or UC patients, to allow for a
      statistically valid analysis, are now urgently required to standardize test
      performance and determine the true sensitivity and specificity of the miRNA
      screening approach, and to provide a numerical underpinning for these diseases as
      a function of total RNA. Moreover, when a miRNA screening test is combined with
      analysis of a messenger(m)RNA expression test, which has also been considered in 
      earlier studies to be a highly sensitive and a very specific and reliable
      transcriptomic approach, as outlined in this article, bioinformatics can be used 
      to correlate microRNA seed data with mRNA target data in order to gain a
      mechanistic understanding of how miRNAs regulate gene expression, enabling
      understanding of why these miRNA genes should be informative in a screening test.

PG  - 61-6
AB  - The discovery that RNA interference (RNAi) and its functional derivatives, small 
      interfering RNAs (SiRNAs) and micro-RNAs (MiRNAs) could mediate potent and
      specific gene silencing has raised high hopes for cancer therapeutics. The
      prevalence of these small (18-25 nucleotide) non-coding rnas in human gene
      networks, coupled with their unique specificity, has paved the way for the
      development of new and promising therapeutic strategies in re-directing or
      inhibiting small rna phenomena.Three strategies are currently being developed: De
      novo RNAi programming using synthetic SiRNAS to target the expression of genes.
      Strengthening or recapitulation of the physiologic targeting of messenger RNAs by
      specific MiRNAs. Sequence-specific inhibition of Mi RNA functions by nucleic acid
      analogs. Each strategy, currently being developed both in academia and in
      industry, holds promise in cancer therapeutics.

AB  - AIM: To construct the RNAi eukaryotic vector of inhibitory member of the
      prohibitin (PHB-1) gene and observe the interfering effect in HEK293 cell line
      after the vector transfection. METHODS: The specific Mi RNA sequence was designed
      according to the PHB-1 sequence in GenBank, complementary single-strand DNA
      oligonucleotides were designed and synthesized, and annealed the single-stranded 
      oligonucleotides to generate a double strands oligonucleotides , cloned the
      oligonucleotides into pcDNATM6.2-GW/EmGFP-MiR-PHB to obtain an entry clone and
      then sequence analysis was performed. The recombinant plasmid was transfected
      into HEK293 cell by liposome. PHB-1 expression was detected by Western blotting. 
      RESULTS: The DNA sequence of interest clone to the vector was constructed to
      generate an entry clone and an expression clone successfully, which were proved
      by sequence determination. Western blotting analysis demonstrated that PHB-1 MiR 
      RNA expression construction could suppress the expression of PHB-1. CONCLUSION: A
      RNAi eukaryotic vector containing prohibitin gene was successfully constructed.

      RNA that have regulator functions within cells. Currently, over 470 human miRNA
      genes are predicted to exist and are annotated within the "miRBase" public miRNA 
      database ( http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/ ). There is no denying that short
      interfering (si) and short hairpin (sh) RNAs have revolutionized how scientists
      approach understanding gene function; however, si and shRNAs are not effective
      for analyzing the function of miRNAs given that miRNAs are typically short (17-24
      bases). In turn, new sets of agents that allow for the expression of miRNA above 
      endogenous levels and inhibition of miRNAs have become a valuable technology for 
      the study of these small regulatory RNAs. In this chapter, we provide
      step-by-step methods on how to utilize synthetic precursor and antisense
      inhibitor molecules for understanding miRNA function.

AB  - Adipogenesis involves cell proliferation and differentiation, both of which have 
      been shown to be regulated by micro (mi)RNA. During mouse preadipocyte 3T3L1 cell
      differentiation, we found that miR-17-92, a miRNA cluster that promotes cell
      proliferation in various cancers, was significantly up-regulated at the clonal
      expansion stage of adipocyte differentiation. Stable transfection of 3T3L1 cells 
      with miR-17-92 resulted in accelerated differentiation and increased triglyceride
      accumulation after hormonal stimulation. By using a luciferase reporter assay, we
      demonstrated that miR-17-92 directly targeted the 3' UTR region of Rb2/p130,
      accounting for subsequently reduced Rb2/p130 mRNA and protein quantities at the
      stage of clonal expansion. siRNA-mediated knock-down of Rb2/p130 at the same
      stage of clonal expansion recapitulated the phenotype of overexpression of
      miR-17-92 in the stably transfected 3T3L1 cells. These data indicate that
      miR-17-92 promotes adipocyte differentiation by targeting and negatively
      regulating Rb2/p130.

AB  - Dicot Dicer-like (DCL) enzymes operate preferably on GC rich regions when
      producing small interfering (si)RNA and micro (mi)RNA. This GC bias, however, is 
      not generic in monocot miRNA productions. From wild Dactylis glomerata naturally 
      infected by Cocksfoot streak potyvirus (CSV), CSV-siRNAs had a greater GC% than
      the virus genome, indicating that GC rich regions were also preferred by the
      grass DCLs. This supports the notion that GC preference is an ancient feature for
      plant DCLs, and suggests that monocot miRNA genes might have evolved to a high
      GC% resulting in GC bias being not detectable during mature miRNA production.

PG  - 240-52
AB  - The cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) 2b protein suppresses RNA silencing and
      determines viral symptoms. Among Arabidopsis thaliana lines expressing 2b
      proteins from mild (LS and Q CMV) or severe (Fny CMV) strains, only Fny
      2b-transgenic plants displayed strong symptom-like phenotypes in leaves, stems
      and flowers, together with stunting of main root growth and increased emergence
      of lateral roots. However, LS and Fny 2b proteins both enhanced lateral root
      length. Micro (mi)RNA-mediated cellular mRNA turnover was inhibited in Fny
      2b-transgenic plants, but there was no evidence for this in LS 2b-transgenic
      plants. Both 2b proteins efficiently suppressed small interfering
      (si)RNA-mediated RNA silencing, suggesting that 2b proteins can target the siRNA 
      pathway without disrupting miRNA-regulated RNA turnover. Thus, symptom induction 
      is not an inevitable consequence of RNA silencing suppression. For CMV,
      strain-specific differences between the 2b silencing proteins determine whether
      only one or both small RNA-guided RNA destruction pathways are disrupted.

TI  - siRNA, miRNA and HIV: promises and challenges.
PG  - 935-46
AB  - Small interfering RNA (siRNA) and microRNA (miRNA) are small RNAs of 18-25
      nucleotides (nt) in length that play important roles in regulating gene
      expression. They are incorporated into an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC)
      and serve as guides for silencing their corresponding target mRNAs based on
      complementary base-pairing. The promise of gene silencing has led many
      researchers to consider siRNA as an anti-viral tool. However, in long-term
      settings, many viruses appear to escape from this therapeutical strategy. An
      example of this may be seen in the case of human immunodeficiency virus type-1
      (HIV-1) which is able to evade RNA silencing by either mutating the
      siRNA-targeted sequence or by encoding for a partial suppressor of RNAi (RNA
      interference). On the other hand, because miRNA targeting does not require
      absolute complementarity of base-pairing, mutational escape by viruses from
      miRNA-specified silencing may be more difficult to achieve. In this review, we
      discuss stratagems used by various viruses to avoid the cells' antiviral
      si/mi-RNA defenses and notions of how viruses might control and regulate host
      cell genes by encoding viral miRNAs (vmiRNAs).

TI  - Evidence for nuclear processing of plant micro RNA and short interfering RNA
      precursors.
PG  - 1382-90
AB  - The Arabidopsis genome encodes four Dicer-like (DCL) proteins, two of which
      contain putative nuclear localization signals. This suggests one or more nuclear 
      pathways for processing double-stranded (ds) RNA in plants. To study the
      subcellular location of processing of nuclear-encoded dsRNA involved in
      transcriptional silencing, we examined short interfering (si) RNA and micro (mi) 
      RNA accumulation in transgenic Arabidopsis expressing nuclear and cytoplasmic
      variants of P19, a viral protein that suppresses posttranscriptional gene
      silencing. P19 binds specifically to DCL-generated 21- to 25-nucleotide (nt)
      dsRNAs with 2-nt 3' overhangs and reportedly suppresses the accumulation of all
      size classes of siRNA. Nuclear P19 resulted in a significant reduction of 21- to 
      22-nt siRNAs and a 21-nt miRNA, but had a lesser effect on 24-nt siRNAs.
      Cytoplasmic P19 did not decrease the quantity but resulted in a 2-nt truncation
      of siRNAs and miRNA. This suggests that the direct products of DCL cleavage of
      dsRNA precursors of 21- to 22-nt siRNAs and miRNA are present in the nucleus,
      where their accumulation is partially repressed, and in the cytoplasm, where both
      normal sized and truncated forms accumulate. DCL1, which contains two putative
      nuclear localization signals, is required for miRNA production but not siRNA
      production. DCL1-green fluorescent protein fusion proteins localize to nuclei in 
      transient expression assays, indicating that DCL1 is a nuclear protein. The
      results are consistent with a model in which dsRNA precursors of miRNAs and at
      least some 21- to 22-nt siRNAs are processed in the nucleus, the former by
      nuclear DCL1 and the latter by an unknown nuclear DCL.

TI  - Differential synthesis of beta-major and beta-minor globin proteins in murine
      erythroleukemia cells is regulated at the transcriptional level.
PG  - 3216-9
AB  - We compared the transcription and translation of globin genes in three mouse
      erythroleukemia cell lines under different conditions in which there is
      differential expression of beta-major (beta ma) and beta-minor (beta mi).
      Transcription was measured by pulse labeling of whole cell RNA with [3H]uridine, 
      and translation by labeling whole cell protein synthesis with [3H]leucine.
      Induction with dimethyl sulfoxide led to increased transcription of alpha, beta
      ma, and beta mi genes, and the proportion of beta mi RNA synthesized was similar 
      to the proportion of beta mi globin protein produced, whether the cells produced 
      30-40% beta mi (lines 745 and 9M) or greater than 80% beta mi (clone 25-66).
      Induction with hemin did not lead to increased globin gene transcription in any
      line, although globin protein synthesis did increase. Thus, the mechanism of beta
      globin chain induction depends on the inducing agent, and not on the cell line or
      the type of beta globin gene product. The relative proportion of beta mi and beta
      ma globin chain proteins reflects the relative transcription of the two beta
      genes, whether or not transcription increased following induction.
