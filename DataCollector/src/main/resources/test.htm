TI  - Has large-scale named-entity network analysis been resting on a flawed
      assumption?

AB  - The assumption that a name uniquely identifies an entity introduces two types of 
      errors: splitting treats one entity as two or more (because of name variants);
      lumping treats multiple entities as if they were one (because of shared names).
      Here we investigate the extent to which splitting and lumping affect
      commonly-used measures of large-scale named-entity networks within two
      disambiguated bibliographic datasets: one for co-author names in biomedicine
      (PubMed, 2003-2007); the other for co-inventor names in U.S. patents (USPTO,
      2003-2007). In both cases, we find that splitting has relatively little effect,
      whereas lumping has a dramatic effect on network measures. For example, in the
      biomedical co-authorship network, lumping (based on last name and both initials) 
      drives several measures down: the global clustering coefficient by a factor of 4 
      (from 0.265 to 0.066); degree assortativity by a factor of approximately 13 (from
      0.763 to 0.06); and average shortest path by a factor of 1.3 (from 5.9 to 4.5).
